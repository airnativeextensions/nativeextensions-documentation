import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

This version deprecates the "add to camera roll" functionality. 

This functionality is better covered in the CameraRollExtended extension and we believe the duplication here is unneccessary.
Particularly due to all the file system changes in Android that require additional handling of the files to share them with the camera roll.

Migration should be relatively straight forward, just replace the `Image.service.saveToCameraRoll()` with `CameraRollExtended.service.addBitmapData()`.

For more information see the documentation on the [CameraRollExtended](/docs/camerarollextended/adding-files).
