The following guide is used to manually install the extension, download dependencies and update the application descriptor. We highly recommend installing extensions using `apm`. Using `apm` will automate the installation and automatically handle updates and dependencies along with greatly simplifying the application descriptor generation.

The `com.distriqt.ironsource.AdMob` ANE includes the IronSource AdMob mediation adapter. This is everything you need to get AdMob mediation working in your application.

To add the ANE download it from the repository and add it to your application:

- [com.distriqt.ironsource.AdMob](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-IronSource/raw/master/lib/admob/com.distriqt.ironsource.AdMob.ane)


More information on adding ANEs in this [tutorial](/docs/tutorials/getting-started)



#### Android Support

The Android Support libraries encompass the Android Support, Android X and common Google libraries.

These libraries are specific to Android. There are no issues including these on all platforms, they are just **required** for Android.

This extension requires the following extensions:

- [`androidx.appcompat`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.appcompat.ane)
- [`androidx.browser`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.browser.ane)
- [`androidx.core`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.core.ane)
- [`androidx.constraintlayout`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.constraintlayout.ane)
- [`androidx.vectordrawable`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.vectordrawable.ane)
- [`androidx.room`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.room.ane)
- [`androidx.work`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.work.ane)
- [`com.google.guava`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.google.guava.ane)
- [`com.google.code.gson`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.google.code.gson.ane)

You can access these extensions here: [https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport).

> **Note**: if you have been using the older `com.distriqt.androidsupport.*` (Android Support) extensions you should remove these extensions and replace it with the `androidx` extensions listed above. This is the new version of the android support libraries and moving forward all our extensions will require AndroidX.
