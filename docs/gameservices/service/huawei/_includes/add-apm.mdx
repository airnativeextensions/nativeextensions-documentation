Note: All of the commands below should be run in a terminal / command prompt in the root directory of your application, generally the level above your source directory.

import SetupAPM from '../../../../_includes/apm/setup-apm.mdx'

<SetupAPM />


### Install the extension 

Install the extension by running: 

```
apm install com.distriqt.GameServices-huawei
```

This will download and install the extension, required assets, and all dependencies.

Once complete `apm` will have created something like the following file structure: 

```
.
|____ assets
| |____ android
| | |____ grs_sdk_global_route_config_apptouchupdatesdk.json
| | |____ grs_sdk_global_route_config_hmscoreInstallerSDK.json
| | |____ grs_sdk_global_route_config_opensdkService.json
| | |____ grs_sdk_global_route_config_updatesdk.json
| | |____ grs_sdk_server_config.json
| | |____ grs_sp.bks
| | |____ hmsincas.bks
| | |____ updatesdkcas.bks
|____ ane
| |____ com.distriqt.GameServices.ane	# GameServices extension
| |____ [dependencies]
|____ apm_packages						# cache directory - ignore
|____ project.apm						# apm project file
```

- Add the `ane` directory to your IDE. *See the tutorials located [here](/docs/tutorials/getting-started) on adding an extension to your IDE.*

- You may have an `assets` directory that contains required assets for the installed extensions. 
You must add the files in the `assets/android` folder to the root of your Android application package. 
(It contains the resource files for the Huawei SDK). You do not need to add this to your iOS application package.


:::info
We suggest you use the locations directly in your builds rather than copying the files elsewhere. 
The reason for this is if you ever go to update the extensions using `apm` that these updates will be pulled into your build automatically.
:::


:::note Variants
If you wish to support both Huawei Game Services and Google Play Games you should install the `com.distriqt.GameServices-allservices` package variant instead. 
This will correctly install all the Play Games dependencies along with Huawei Game Services.

All variants support Game Center on iOS / macOS / tvOS.
:::


- You may need to set some configuration items such as the Google Play Games application identifier. Call the following to step through the configuration values for this extension:

```
apm project config set com.distriqt.GameServices
```
