# Flurry

This extension gives you the ability to access the Access to the Flurry Analytics service. 

The simple API allows you to quickly integrate Flurry access in your AIR application in just a few lines of code. 
Identical code base can be used across all platforms allowing you to concentrate on your application and not device specifics.

We provide complete guides to get you up and running with asset selection quickly and easily.

As with all our extensions you get access to a year of support and updates as we are continually improving and updating the extensions for OS updates and feature requests.


This Wiki forms the best source of detailed documentation for the extension along with the [asdocs](http://docs.airnativeextensions.com/asdocs/flurry/).
