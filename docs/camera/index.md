# Camera

The [Camera](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Camera) extension provides access to advanced features of the camera not available through the AIR SDK.

This includes access to the flash modes, exposure, white balance, and focus point control.

Additionally this extension allows you to take a photo using the camera while simultaneously saving it to the camera roll and accessing it in your AIR application as `BitmapData`.

Please note this is not a replacement for the `flash.media.CameraUI` class but gives you the ability to build your own.

If you are looking for a Camera UI replacement see the [CameraUI](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.CameraUI) extension.

Identical code base can be used across all supported platforms allowing you to concentrate on your application and not device specifics.

### Features
