The simplest way to install and manage your AIR native extensions and libraries is to use the AIR Package Manager (`apm`). We highly recommend using `apm`, as it will handle downloading all required dependencies and manage your application descriptor (Android manifest additions, iOS info additions etc).

However you can choose to install it manually, as you would have done in the past. 

## Install

<Tabs
groupId="packagemanager"
defaultValue="apm"
values={[
	{label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
	{label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
]}>

<TabItem value="apm" >
	<InstallAPM/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual" >
	<InstallManual/>
</TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Application Descriptor

<Tabs
groupId="packagemanager"
defaultValue="apm"
values={[
	{label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
	{label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
]}>

<TabItem value="apm" >
	<AppDescriptorAPM/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual" >
	<AppDescriptorManual/>
</TabItem>

### iOS App Transport Security

Since iOS 9, Apple has introduced the concept of App Transport Security (ATS). is encouraging the use of HTTPS

App Transport Security (ATS) lets an app add a declaration to its Info.plist file that specifies 
the domains with which it needs secure communication. ATS prevents accidental disclosure, provides 
secure default behaviour, and is easy to adopt. You should adopt ATS as soon as possible, regardless 
of whether you're creating a new app or updating an existing one. 

If you're developing a new app, you should use HTTPS exclusively. If you have an existing app, you 
should use HTTPS as much as you can right now, and create a plan for migrating the rest of your app 
as soon as possible.

In simple terms, this means that if your application attempts to connect to any HTTP server 
(in this example, `yourserver.com`) that doesnâ€™t support the latest SSL technology (TLSv1.2), 
your connections will fail with an error.

Basically the repercussions mean that you will need to add exceptions in for any non secure domain 
you access. For example the following adds an exception for the `yourserver.com` domain and subdomains.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
<key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
<dict>
	<key>yourserver.com</key>
	<dict>
	<!--Include to allow subdomains-->
	<key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
	<true/>
	<!--Include to allow HTTP requests-->
	<key>NSTemporaryExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
	<true/>
	</dict>
</dict>
</dict>
```

To read more about this there is a great article [here](https://medium.com/@squeakytoy/configuring-app-transport-security-exceptions-in-ios-9-and-osx-10-11-94a62f844944)

<Tabs
groupId="packagemanager"
defaultValue="apm"
values={[
	{label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
	{label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
]}>

<TabItem value="apm" >


To add these additions you need to add some additional configuration. Firstly add a custom iOS configuration file by running:

```
apm generate config ios
```

Edit the `config/ios/InfoAdditions.xml` file that was generated to resemble the following, adding the `NSAppTransportSecurity` node:

```xml
<plist version="1.0">
	<dict>

		<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
		<dict>
			<!-- Include to allow all connections -->
			<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
			<true/>
		</dict>

	</dict>
</plist>
```

Once you have added this configuration run the steps above to update / generate your [application descriptor](#application-descriptor).


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual" >

To add these values manually, open up your application descriptor and insert the `NSAppTransportSecurity` node into your `InfoAdditions`.

```xml
<iPhone>
	<InfoAdditions><![CDATA[

		<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
		<dict>
			<!-- Include to allow all connections -->
			<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
			<true/>
		</dict>

	]]></InfoAdditions>
</iPhone>
```

## Windows 

### .Net Framework

This extension requires v4.6 or higher of the .Net framework. This should come preinstalled on any Windows 10 or higher machine so if you are targetting those you should not have to do anything. If however you are targetting older versions of Windows you must ensure .Net v4.6 or higher is installed either manually or as part of an installer.


### C++ Redistributable

The native code has a dependency on the Visual C++ 2017 Redistributable package. This package contains code that is required to run code developed using C++ in Visual Studio and is very common amongst Windows applications.

There are two ways to ensure this is available to your application:

- Create an installer that runs the redistributable installer;
- Package the required DLL files from the redistributable with your application;

The first is the suggested method. Installing the redistributable via an installer allows it to be put into the windows update process, allowing bug fixes and security updates to be handled automatically.

The second method is only advised if you need a complete standalone application, where you don't (or cannot) use an installation process. This requires you to package DLLs from the redistributable with your application. 


### Creating an Installer

There are many methods to create application installers and many tutorials available. We suggest you find a method suitable to your environment and application and utilise the tutorials online. 

Some methods include:

- [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)
- [Wix](http://wixtoolset.org/)
	- [WixEdit](http://wixedit.sourceforge.net)


Tutorials:

- [Generating a Windows installer](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/articles/customize-setup-for-AIR-app-with-captive-runtime.html)


You need to include the x86 c++ 2017 redistributable in the installer, there are many examples and documentation online to achieve this.

>
> **The advantage of this method is that the libraries will be updated along with any system updates and will not require manual updating of the libraries and releasing of your application.**
>


### Packaging DLLs

Packaging the DLLs into your application involves copying the DLLs specified below into your application root and including in your application package.

The best option is to install Visual Studio 2017 and locate the `Program Files[ (x86)]\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\edition\VC\Redist\MSVC\lib-version` folder, eg: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Redist\MSVC\14.16.27012\x86\Microsoft.VC141.CRT`

Alternatively, download and install the x86 redistributable from the [Microsoft website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). This should install the DLLs into `C:\Windows\System32` folder. 


Open the folder and copy the following DLLs to your application:

- `msvcp140.dll`
- `vcruntime140.dll`

If you are having issues locating these files, feel free to contact us for help.
