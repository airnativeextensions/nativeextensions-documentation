The following guide is used to manually install the extension, download dependencies and update the application descriptor. We highly recommend installing extensions using `apm`. Using `apm` will automate the installation and automatically handle updates and dependencies along with greatly simplifying the application descriptor generation.

First step is always to add the extension to your development environment. Download the extension from the repository and then follow the tutorial located [here](/docs/tutorials/getting-started) to add the extension to your development environment.

The Facebook Share SDK is contained in the `com.distriqt.facebook.Share` extension.

This extension depends upon the Facebook Core SDK so you will need to make sure you have added the `com.distriqt.facebook.Core` extension before continuing.

[Add the Facebook Core extension](../../core/add-the-extension.mdx)

### Dependencies

There are no additional dependencies beyond the dependencies added for the facebook core extension.
