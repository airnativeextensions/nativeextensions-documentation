The following guide is used to manually install the extension, download dependencies and update the application descriptor. We highly recommend installing extensions using `apm`. Using `apm` will automate the installation and automatically handle updates and dependencies along with greatly simplifying the application descriptor generation.

First step is always to add the extension to your development environment. 

:::caution Firebase Core
You must have gone through the setup of the Firebase Core extension before attempting to proceed with this extension.

Make sure you have added all the extensions required for the Firebase Core extension as outlined [here](../../core/add-the-extensions.mdx).

### Firebase Storage

The main additional extension is the Storage ANE, however you must add the Auth extension as well:

- [`com.distriqt.firebase.Storage`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Firebase/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.firebase.Storage.ane)
- [`com.distriqt.firebase.Auth`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Firebase/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.firebase.Auth.ane)


Download the extension from the repository and then follow the tutorial located [here](/docs/tutorials/getting-started) to add the extension to your development environment.
