# Application Rater

The [Application Rater](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.ApplicationRater) extension allows you to ask the user for feedback on your application by displaying a native dialog and asking them to rate your application in the appropriate application store. When the user agrees to rate your application they are taken to your applications page in the store.

It also allows you to control this process yourself and use the extension to correctly redirect to the appropriate store review page.


The simple API allows you to quickly integrate application rating in your AIR application in just a few lines of code. Identical code base can be used across all platforms allowing you to concentrate on your application and not device specifics.

We provide complete guides to get you up and running with asset selection quickly and easily.


As with all our extensions you get access to a year of support and updates as we are continually improving and updating the extensions for OS updates and feature requests.
