This guide shows how to add mediation through Facebook Audience to your IronSource integration.


## Step 1: Set up Facebook Audience Network 

Setup Facebook Audience network:

https://developers.ironsrc.com/ironsource-mobile/air/facebook-mediation-guide/#step-1



## Step 2: Configure mediation settings in IronSource

There are 3 pieces of Data from the Facebook Audience Network account which need to be inserted into your ironSource Network Setup Module in order for Facebook Audience Network to work correctly in connection with ironSource. See the IronSource guide for more information:

https://developers.ironsrc.com/ironsource-mobile/air/facebook-mediation-guide/#step-7



## Step 3: Import the Facebook Audience Network SDK and adapter ANE

The simplest way to install and manage your AIR native extensions and libraries is to use the AIR Package Manager (`apm`). We highly recommend using `apm`, as it will handle downloading all required dependencies and manage your application descriptor (Android manifest additions, iOS info additions etc).

However you can choose to install it manually, as you would have done in the past. 

### Add the Extension

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<InstallAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<InstallManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>


### Application Descriptor

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<AppDescriptorAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<AppDescriptorManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>



**If you are using an old version of AIR you will need to resign your application following the guide below otherwise your build will likely fail signing validation. AIR 33.1.1.476 or higher do not need this additional step.**



## Step 4: Additional code required

There is no additional code required.



## Step 5: Facebook Additional Settings


### CCPA Support 

If you are using Facebook adapter 4.3.17+, make sure to follow Facebook Audience Network instructions, as described [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/data-processing-options#audience-network-sdk). Please note that setting FAN Limited Data Use flag, should be done before initializing ironSource Mediation.

To set this in actionscript call the `setDataProcessingOptions()` method on the `AdSettings` instance.

To explicitly not enable Limited Data Use (LDU) mode, use:

```actionscript
FacebookAudience.instance.adSettings.setDataProcessingOptions( [] ); 
```

To enable LDU for users and specify user geography, use:
- Country: 1 to indicate USA
- State: 1000 to indicate California.

```actionscript
FacebookAudience.instance.adSettings.setDataProcessingOptions( ["LDU"], 1, 1000 ); 
```

To enable LDU for users with geolocation, use:
- Country: 0 to request that we geolocate that event
- State: 0 to request that we geolocate that event.

```actionscript
FacebookAudience.instance.adSettings.setDataProcessingOptions( ["LDU"], 0, 0 ); // enable LDU for users with geolocation
```



### iOS 14+ Support

If you are using Facebook adapter 4.3.20+, and building for iOS14+, FAN requires you to set the `setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled` flag. This allows you to inform Facebook whether to use the data to deliver personalized ads. If the flag is set to false FAN will not be able to deliver personalized ads. 

Please note that setting the `setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled` flag should be done before initializing ironSource Mediation. Learn more about Advertising Tracking Enabled for Audience Network [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/audience-network/setting-up/platform-setup/ios/advertising-tracking-enabled). 


```actionscript
FacebookAudience.instance.adSettings.setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled( true );
```





# Signing your iOS application

>
> This is no longer required since AIR AIR 33.1.1.476
>

With AIR 27 Adobe partially added the ability to use dynamic frameworks in your iOS application, which works fine with frameworks you control however still has issues with third party frameworks.

Everything will work up to a point, however AIR will incorrectly sign your IPA and it will fail AppStore submission with an error from the Application Loader tool and installing development builds with a signature validation error.

To get around this, before you upload or install your application you will need to run a script to resign your IPA. 
This script is available in the repository alongside the ANE in the `scripts` directory.

>
> **This script will only work on a macOS machine with Xcode installed and your certificate installed in Keychain**
>

Copy this script to a directory in your development environment.

Firstly edit the script to change the details of the IPA, provisioning profile and signing identity for your application. These details are located at the top of the script.


```
#####################################
## CONFIG

# You need to set the values below for your application
# We suggest they are full paths to the files. 

# The path to the ipa generated from your AIR application packaging
IPA="/path/to/yourApp.ipa"

# The distribution provisioning profile for your application
PROVISIONING_PROFILE="/path/to/profile.mobileprovision"

# The name of the signing identity. You get this by running the following in a terminal 
# and selecting the name of your distribution certificate:
# 
# security find-identity -v -p codesigning
SIGNING_IDENTITY="iPhone Distribution: XXXXXXXXX (XXXXX)"
```


Now open a Terminal at the script location. *You will need to run the script from this directory.*

```
./resign
```

This should output a few informational items to the console and then once complete you should have a new IPA file in the directory named: `yourApp_resigned.ipa`. If there were any errors or warnings displayed, make sure the information above is all correct.

This resigned IPA is the file you should use.
