Getting your AIR application to run on the Windows Store requires you to go through 
some specific conversions to convert the AIR package into an UWP app which can be 
submitted to the Store.

This process involves several steps, creating an installer from your AIR captive runtime
bundle and using the **Desktop App Converter** to convert for the store.
