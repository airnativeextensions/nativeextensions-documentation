## iOS support

iOS is not possible to support to the level of connectivity we have created in this extension. 
The iOS SDK is simply too limiting and the required Bluetooth functionality is hidden in a 
private framework which will cause an application to be rejected if we used it.

The only option for Bluetooth on iOS is to use [Bluetooth LE](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.BluetoothLE).
