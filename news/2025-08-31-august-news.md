> August Release Roundup: Major updates across several extensions  

This month brings one of the biggest waves of updates we've seen recently, with multiple major version releases, SDK updates, and a few important deprecations to note.  A lot of these updates bring improved compatibility with Android 35 with the major view changes that are required with any app updates now.

This August has been a month of **major foundation upgrades** - from Firebase and Play Services to Media Player and Adverts. While some updates require careful migration (especially Firebase and Game Services), they set developers up with the latest features, improved stability, and compliance with upcoming platform changes.  

If you're using any of these extensions, now is the time to update your projects and plan migrations ahead of deprecations like **Firebase Dynamic Links**.
