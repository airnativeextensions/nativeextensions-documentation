The simplest way to install and manage your AIR native extensions and libraries is to use the AIR Package Manager (`apm`). We highly recommend using `apm`, as it will handle downloading all required dependencies and manage your application descriptor (Android manifest additions, iOS info additions etc).

However you can choose to install it manually, as you would have done in the past. 

## Install

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<InstallAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<InstallManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>


## Application Descriptor

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<AppDescriptorAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<AppDescriptorManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>



## Checking for Support

You can use the `isSupported` flag to determine if this extension is supported on the current platform and device.

This allows you to react to whether the functionality is available on the device and provide an alternative solution if not.


```actionscript
if (Battery.isSupported)
{
	// Functionality here
}
```



## Desktop implementation

The desktop implementations for macOS and Windows use a `NativeProcess` to connect to execute a script that determines the current state of the battery. In order for this to work you must be using extendedDesktop profile.

>
> The NativeProcess class and its capabilities are only available to AIR applications installed with a native installer (extended desktop profile applications). When debugging, you can pass the `-profile extendedDesktop` argument to ADL to enable the NativeProcess functionality. 
>

Please note that the desktop (macOS and Windows) implementation may give you a warning about using the default implementation. This is expected as those platforms are completely handled by the default library.
