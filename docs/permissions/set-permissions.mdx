You must inform the extension which permissions you wish to request.
This is done by passing an array of `String`s each being the permission required.

For example to set the camera permission:

```actionscript
Permissions.service.setPermissions( 
    [ 
        "android.permission.CAMERA" 
    ] 
);
```

A complete list of the possible permissions is found [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission).


## Adding Permissions 

In addition to informing the extension of the permissions you must add these permissions to your application's manifest.

Permissions are represented with a tag like the following:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >

To add these permissions you need to add some additional configuration to apm. 
Firstly add a custom Android configuration file by running:

```
apm generate config android
```

Edit the `config/android/AndroidManifest.xml` file that was generated to resemble the following, adding the required permissions, eg:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">

	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />

</manifest>
```

You can add any other additions you require in your application here and these will be merged by `apm` when you generate your application descriptor.

:::info
Make sure you regenerate your application descriptor after modifying this file. See the section in [add the extension](add-the-extension.mdx#application-descriptor) for details.
:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >

To manually add permissions to your application, you will need to edit the manifest additions node in your application descriptor. 
For example, to add the camera permission:


```xml
<android>
  <manifestAdditions><![CDATA[
    <manifest android:installLocation="auto">

      <!-- PERMISSIONS -->
      <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />


      <!-- OTHER MANIFEST ADDITIONS -->


    </manifest>
  ]]></manifestAdditions>
</android>
```


  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>
