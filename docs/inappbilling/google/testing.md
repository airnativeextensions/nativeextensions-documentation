In order to test Google Play Billing you simply need to add an apk to a test channel and sign in to a device using a user who has signed up for this channel.

A couple of notes:

- Ensure you have completed the setup of your products, they must have been through review before they will appear correctly; 
- Ensure you have uploaded and have pushed to a test channel at least one apk of with the billing permission in the manifest;
- Ensure your user has completely signed up for the beta, they need to be added to a test user group and then actually join the test channel (generally through a link);
