# Notifications

The [Notifications](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Notifications) extension enables the use of Local Notifications 
on your device giving you the ability to easily engage your users on their device without having to setup remote notification servers.

The simple API will have you up and running with notifications in just a few lines of code. Identical code base can be used 
across all platforms without any platfrom specific code, allowing you to develop once and deploy everywhere!
