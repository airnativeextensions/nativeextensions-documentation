New Payment System and Custom Development Work\\n\\nOver the past six months, we\u2019ve been working closely with Harman to bring a smarter, more efficient dependency system to AIR. Our new approach replaces embedded dependencies with Gradle dependencies, making extension management easier, faster, and more resilient.\\n\\nWhat this means for you:\\n\\n- Smaller extension file sizes \u2013 Free up space & streamline your builds\\n- Faster compilation times \u2013 Get things done in record time\\n- No more manual manifest additions \u2013 Spend less time on setup\\n- Better dependency resolution \u2013 Seamless updates and fewer conflicts\\n- Improved compatibility \u2013 Extensions work together more smoothly\\n\\nThese improvements happen behind the scenes, making everything more stable and maintainable. But you\u2019ll definitely notice the difference with **smaller files**, **fewer manifest changes**, and **much faster builds**. \ud83d\ude80\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n:::note\\nImportant: This update is generally not compatible with our traditional approach. To take advantage of these improvements, you\u2019ll need to update all your extensions at once.\\n:::\\n\\nGot questions? We\u2019re here to help! [Let\u2019s build better, faster, and smarter together.](#custom-development-work) \ud83d\udca1\\n\\n\\n--- \\n\\n![](images/loading.png)\\n\\n### Updating\\n\\nThe best and simplest approach to updating your extensions is to use `apm`. \\nIf you are yet to start using `apm`, we highly recommend installing this tool and integrating it into your project.\\n\\n:::info AIR Package Manager\\nThe AIR Package Manager (`apm`) is the AIR SDK package manager and allows management of AIR libraries and extensions along with a range of utilities that assist in creation of an AIR application.\\n\\nTo download and install the AIR SDK Manager, check the [Install APM](https://airsdk.dev/docs/basics/install-apm) guide.\\n\\nYou can also read a case study of [Migrating to the AIR Package Manager](https://github.com/airsdk/apm/discussions/75).\\n:::\\n\\n#### APM\\n\\nUpdating to the latest extensions is simply a matter of using the `apm` tool to update:\\n\\n```\\napm update\\napm generate app-descriptor\\n```\\n\\nThis process will update all your project\'s extensions to the latest releases and then update your application descriptor appropriately including modifying the manifest additions and info additions correctly.\\n\\n\\n#### Manual\\n\\nManual updating will require downloading the latest releases of all your extensions and dependencies and then a careful reconstruction of the manifest additions. \\n\\nFirstly go to the github repository for all of the extensions you are using and download the latest release.\\n\\nThen when updating the manifest additions we recommend starting fresh as there have been a lot of entries to be removed. The minimum manifest additions now look something like the following:\\n\\n```xml\\n<manifest android:installLocation=\\"auto\\" >\\n  <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\\"21\\" android:targetSdkVersion=\\"34\\"/>\\n  <uses-permission android:name=\\"android.permission.INTERNET\\"/>\\n  <application>\\n    <meta-data android:name=\\"android.max_aspect\\" android:value=\\"2.5\\"/>\\n    <meta-data android:name=\\"android.notch_support\\" android:value=\\"true\\"/>\\n\\n    <activity android:name=\\"com.distriqt.core.auth.AuthorisationActivity\\" android:exported=\\"false\\" android:theme=\\"@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar\\"/>\\n  </application>\\n</manifest>\\n```\\n\\nYou will need to go through each extension you are using and add in any specific permissions, activities, receivers and services for those extensions. \\n\\nWe have added migration guides for most of the extensions highlighting the changes so you can check these for help in updating, for example:\\n\\n- [Adverts](https://docs.airnativeextensions.com/docs/adverts/migrating-to-version-16.0)\\n- [InAppBilling](https://docs.airnativeextensions.com/docs/inappbilling/migration-v16.0)\\n- [Firebase](https://docs.airnativeextensions.com/docs/firebase/migrating-to-v10.0)\\n- [PushNotifications](https://docs.airnativeextensions.com/docs/pushnotifications/migrating-to-v16.0)\\n\\n\\n\\n--- \\n\\n![](images/airnativeextension-packages.png)\\n\\n### New Payment System\\n\\nNext month we are migrating to a new payment provider. Unfortunately our existing provider will no longer support certain tax durisdictions which has meant we either had to stop providing our extensions or we move to a new provider. Due to the small timeline given to us we have been scrambling to change over all our systems to support a new provider and ensure there is little disruption to your service. \\n\\nOver the coming weeks we will be sending out information on how to handle your subscription renewals to ensure you continue to have access to the extensions. \\n\\nIf you notice any issues or have any concerns, please reach out to us [airnativeextensions@distriqt.com](mailto:airnativeextensions@distriqt.com)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/custom-development.png)\\n\\n### Custom Development Work\\n\\n**Exciting News \u2013 We\u2019re Expanding Our Development Capacity!**\\n\\nThis year, we\u2019re opening up our schedule to take on more development work!

It provides real user data, error insights, diagnostics, and integrations to improve app quality and user experience.*\\n>\\n\\nThe extension provides error monitoring to monitor app health and streamline your debugging workflow, and automatically converts AIR Errors to native error reports. We developed this extension when reports of the other extension supporting BugSnag was having issues, so we focussed on creating an extension that delivers useful error reports for AIR mobile developers.\\n\\n```actionscript\\ntry\\n{\\n    throw new Error( \\"An error occurred\\", 1023 )\\n}\\ncatch (e:Error)\\n{\\n    BugSnag.instance.notifyError( e );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can access the new extension [here](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.bugsnag/).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AIR Splash Screen Example\\n\\nWith some of the AIR updates from Harman we can now supply native Android splash screens via resoruces. \\n\\nThis process is fairly simple:\\n\\n- Add a custom resources directory (eg `res`) to your app and set `<resdir>res</resdir>` in your manifest (see [custom resources](https://airsdk.dev/docs/tutorials/platform/android/custom-resources) for more info).\\n- Set your target sdk to at least 31 in the manifest additions in your app descriptor:\\n\\n```xml\\n<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\\"24\\" android:targetSdkVersion=\\"34\\" />\\n```\\n\\n- Add a values-v31 directory and create a styles.xml in that folder with the following content:\\n\\n```xml\\n<?xml version=\\"1.0\\" encoding=\\"utf-8\\"?>\\n<resources>\\n\\n\\t<style name=\\"Theme.NoShadow\\" parent=\\"Theme.App.Splash\\">\\n\\t</style>\\n\\n\\t<style name=\\"Theme.App.Splash\\" parent=\\"android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar\\">\\n\\t\\t\x3c!-- Set your splash properties here --\x3e\\n\\t\\t<item name=\\"android:windowSplashScreenBackground\\">#ff0000</item>\\n\\t\\t<item name=\\"android:windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t@drawable/splash_screen_animateable_icon\\n\\t\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item name=\\"android:windowSplashScreenAnimationDuration\\">600</item>\\n\\t\\t<item name=\\"android:windowSplashScreenIconBackgroundColor\\">#004d28</item>\\n\\t</style>\\n\\n</resources>\\n```\\n\\n- Here I have used an animatable icon (drawable/splash_screen_animateable_icon.xml) which could be anything but I\'ve got this in it just showing the app logo:\\n\\n```xml\\n<animation-list xmlns:android=\\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\\"\\n    android:oneshot=\\"true\\">\\n    <item android:drawable=\\"@mipmap/icon\\" android:duration=\\"600\\" />\\n</animation-list>\\n```\\n\\nYou can find a project demonstrating a custom splash screen in this repository: https://github.com/marchbold/air-splashscreen-example\\n\\n--- \\n\\n\\n![](images/firebase.png)\\n\\n### [Firebase](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Firebase)\\n\\nFirebase has been updated to the latest release. \\n\\nFirebase is interconnected with a lot of Google services so these updates are a significant amount of work for us. As part of this update you will find new Google Play Services, AndroidX and square (okio/okhttp) libs.\\n\\nIf you are using `apm` then a simple update and regeneration of the app descriptor should be all you\'ll need to do:\\n\\n```\\napm update\\napm generate app-descriptor\\n```\\n\\nIf you are still managing your dependencies and app descriptor manually, we suggest start from scratch and rebuilding your Android manifest as there are a lot of changes in this build and some new extension dependencies. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n![](images/facebook.png)\\n\\n### [Facebook](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.FacebookAPI)\\n\\nOur Facebook extension has been updated to support v17 of the Facebook SDK.

This is normally done by AIR automatically however with the latest AIR release you can now specify an option on an extension in your application to *delay load* the extension functionality. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\nThe loading process consists of finding and loading the bytes from the `library.swf` within the extension, then parsing this library into the AS3 engine so that it\'s available when applications use symbols from within the extension. As the definitions for classes and interfaces contained within the extension aren\'t accessible before the extension is loaded you must ensure you have clear separation in your code structure of where you use the extensions functionality.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo we suggest separating the loading of the extensions and ensuring all of your usage of extensions are separated into classes that aren\'t accessed until after the load process is completed. \\n\\n\\n\\n## Enabling Delay Load\\n\\n\\nFirstly you will need to enable delayed loading of your extensions by editing your application descriptor and changing the extensions you wish to delay load to have the `delayLoad` attribute as below:\\n\\n```xml\\n<extensionID delayLoad=\\"true\\">com.distriqt.Core</extensionID>\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n:::caution \\nWith this attribute enabled the extension symbols will not be loaded automatically at startup. \\n\\nIf you attempt to use a definition (a class or an interface) from within an extension before it is loaded then you will encounter a runtime error. \\n:::\\n\\n### Issues\\n\\nIt\'s important to understand the side effects of this delay load operation as you may have to restructure your code to support it. \\n\\nThe first issue is that creating instances or calling static methods of a symbol defined in an extension will result in a runtime error. For example, a call to: \\n\\n```actionscript\\nCore.init();\\n```\\n\\nwould result in an error:\\n\\n```\\nError #1065: Variable com.distriqt.extension.core::Core is not defined.\\n```\\n\\n\\nThe second issue can be more critical as it requires careful planning of your function definitions, particularly important for event handlers. \\n\\nIf a function is defined with a parameter of a class from the extension, eg \\n\\n\\n```actionscript\\n// Firstly load the extension ...\\n\\ntestFunction( ... );\\n\\nfunction testFunction( param:SomeExtensionClass ):void\\n{\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\nit will result in a verify error:\\n\\n```\\nVerifyError: Error #1014: Class extension::SomeExtensionClass could not be found.\\n``` \\n\\n**Even though you have loaded the extension before using the function, the definition of the function causes an error.**\\n\\nThis demonstrates why it is important to separate the extensions functionality into a separate class that isn\'t accessed until the extension is loaded. \\n\\ni.e. if this function was moved into another class, say `TestClass`, then you could access this same functionality via the following pseudo code:\\n\\n```actionscript\\n// Firstly load the extension ...\\n\\n// Then use the extension functionality in the TestClass:\\nvar test:TestClass = new TestClass();\\ntest.testFunction( ... );\\n```\\n\\nThis way the definition of the function isn\'t used until after the extension is loaded and you won\'t encounter an error. \\n\\n\\n## Loading an Extension\\n\\nTo load the extension you use methods of the `flash.external.ExtensionContext` class. Loading an extension is a synchronous process and requires the `extensionID` as a parameter:\\n\\n```actionscript\\nExtensionContext.loadExtension( extensionID, null );\\n```\\n\\nImmediately after this call the symbols from the extension will be available so a call to `Core.init();` will now succeed.\\n\\nThis process may still take some time so it is suggested to not just have a series of `loadExtension` calls following one another but instead ensure time passes between each call as part of a load process. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Extension Information\\n\\nThere are a range of helper functionality available in the `ExtensionContext` class to help with loading extensions.\\n\\n\\n### Known Extensions\\n\\nYou can list the extensions that are contained in the application descriptor via the `ExtensionContext.knownExtensions` property. This property is an array of `extensionID` string values each representing an extension identifier listed in the `extensions` node of your application descriptor.\\n\\n```actionscript\\nfor each (var extensionID:String in ExtensionContext.knownExtensions)\\n{\\n    trace( extensionID );\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n### Extension Info\\n\\nThe `ExtensionInfo` class contains information about the state of a particular extension. \\n\\nYou obtain the current information for an extension by calling `getExtensionInfo()`:\\n\\n```actionscript\\nvar info:ExtensionInfo = ExtensionContext.getExtensionInfo( extensionID );\\n```\\n\\nThis class contains a range of information (most of it is extracted from the extension itself) including:\\n- `extensionID`: The identifier for this extension;\\n- `name`: The extension name, as provided in the extension\'s XML descriptor file;\\n- `description`:  The extension description, as provided in the extension\'s XML descriptor file;\\n- `versionNumber`:  The extension version number, as provided in the extension\'s XML descriptor file;\\n\\nAdditionally it contains two properties useful for handling loading of extensions:\\n\\n- `isDynamic`: A Boolean value indicating whether the extension is a \'dynamically loaded\' extension or not, ie. whether the `delayLoad` attribute has been set to `true`;\\n- `isLoaded`: A Boolean value indicating whether the extension has been loaded or not;"},{"id":"2023-11","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2023-11","source":"@site/news/2023-11-30-november-news.md","title":"November 2023","description":"Extension Updates","date":"2023-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 30, 2023","tags":[{"label":"newsletter","permalink":"/news/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"airsdk","permalink":"/news/tags/airsdk"},{"label":"application-rater","permalink":"/news/tags/application-rater"},{"label":"adverts","permalink":"/news/tags/adverts"},{"label":"google-play-billing","permalink":"/news/tags/google-play-billing"}],"readingTime":3.525,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Michael","title":"Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/marchbold","imageURL":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4","key":"marchbold"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-11","title":"November 2023","description":"Extension Updates","image":"images/contacts.png","authors":["marchbold"],"tags":["newsletter","airsdk","application-rater","adverts","google-play-billing"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Delay Loading Extensions","permalink":"/news/2023/12/15/delay-load-extensions"},"nextItem":{"title":"Game Center requirements","permalink":"/news/2023/08/25/game-center-entitlement"}},"content":"> ANE updates, AIR SDK Manager \\n\\nThis year has been remarkably busy and unfortunately news updates were pushed down the list, but as the year comes to a close I\'d like to update on what we see as the major native extension news over the past months.\\n\\nMajor changes across all our extensions include:\\n- iOS/macOS Xcode 14 update that required removal of bitcode support and increasing the minimum sdk to 12;\\n- Android permissions overhaul for new Android 33+ requirements;\\n- Android compatibility when running AIR in a background thread; \\n- Apple Silicon support for our macOS extensions;\\n\\nWe have several major projects in the works including:\\n- Scanner rewrite away from the deprecated library currently in use;\\n- Migration to gradle dependencies in all our dependency extensions;\\n- apm integration with IDEs;\\n\\nSome of the key recent changes are listed below.\\n\\nLooking forward to another year of amazing AIR development!\\n\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/contacts.png)\\n\\n### [Contacts](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Contacts)\\n\\nA complete rewrite of the iOS implementation of the Contacts extension brings the latest functionality from iOS using the newer Contacts framework. \\n\\nThis update should vastly improve performance of contact retrieval and ensures support on the latest versions of iOS.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/gameservices.png)\\n\\n### [Game Services](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.GameServices)\\n\\nWe added support to the Game Services extension for Huawei Game Service v6.10. This extension now gives you access to the major mobile game services:\\n\\n- Apple Game Center (iOS/macOS)\\n- Play Games (Android)\\n- Huawei Game Services (Android)\\n\\nAdditionally we have a major project underway with this extension to update the Play Games implementation to use the newer \\"Play Games v2\\" library. \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/playbilling.png)\\n\\n### [InAppBilling](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.InAppBilling)\\n\\nAll the SDKs have been updated to the latest releases including:\\n\\n- Google Play billing library to version 6;\\n- Amazon to version 3 (including addition of promotions, offers and free trials);\\n- Huawei v6.10\\n\\nThe latest Play Billing library requires an updated version of the Play Store application to be installed on the device so you may want to check for the availability of this before attempting to retrieve the product list. As part of the updates this year we also added an automatic fallback to the older implementation of products / purchases for Google Play Billing in order to keep supporting devices that haven\'t updated the Play Store application. \\n\\nA range of bug fixes including:\\n\\n- correct issue with no event after ui cancelled by user;\\n- correct pending purchase list after purchase consumption;\\n- correctly supply subscription offer for new purchase;\\n\\nWe also have a major project underway with this extension to provide a simplified \\"inventory\\" management wrapper which should handle a lot of the complexities of making purchases. This will be an open source project utilising the extension. We hope to release more on this in the new year. \\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/permissions.png)\\n\\n### [Permissions](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Permissions)\\n\\nThe permissions extension has had some major updates. We found the latest updates to Android had broken the usage of this extension so we completely rewrote the authorisation process to better handle the transition through \\"not determined\\", \\"should explain\\" and then \\"denied\\". We have also added callbacks on several of the permission request processes to make handling permissions in your application much simpler.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/nativewebview.png)\\n\\n### [NativeWebView](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.NativeWebView)\\n\\nThe windows implementation was updated to use the latest chromium release.\\n\\nThe macOS implementation added support for Apple silicon ensuring support on the latest macOS machines. \\n\\nAndroid support for communicating with a WebView when AIR is running on a background thread.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/adobeair.png)\\n\\n### [AIR SDK Manager](https://airsdk.dev/docs/basics/getting-started)\\n\\nThis is an application you can use to manage your AIR SDK installations and update them as new releases are available.

Recent AIR SDK updates has meant we can finally bring a much more recent version of the Facebook SDK to AIR developers on iOS which should be a welcome update to anyone who uses Facebook social or login features in their application. The API has remained unchanged but internally it will be using a much more recent version of the SDK. \\n\\nAdditionally some critical fixes were released including fixing an issue with session not persisting across launches on iOS. \\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/firebase.png)\\n\\n### Firebase\\n\\nThis update brings an update to the iOS SDK. Similar to the Facebook extension, recent updates to the AIR SDK has meant we can now bring a more recent version of the Firebase SDK to iOS developers. This should bring a range of bug fixes and improvements to the underlying Firebase SDK.\\n\\nFirebase Storage extension now provides the ability to [list files](/docs/firebase/storage/list-files) that you have stored in your storage bucket:\\n\\n```actionscript\\nvar ref:StorageReference = FirebaseStorage.service.getReference();\\nref.addEventListener( StorageReferenceListEvent.SUCCESS, listSuccessHandler );\\nref.addEventListener( StorageReferenceListEvent.ERROR, listErrorHandler );\\nref.listAll();\\n\\nfunction listSuccessHandler( event:StorageReferenceListEvent ):void \\n{\\n    // Contains a list of \\"items\\" - each represents a storage item \\n    for each (var item:String in event.items)\\n    {\\n        var ref:StorageReference \\n          = FirebaseStorage.service.getReference( item );\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n![](images/firebase-messaging.png)\\n\\n### Push Notifications\\n\\nThe FCM implementation has been brought inline with the latest Firebase extension bringing a recent version iOS and Android Firebase SDK. This should bring some bug fixes and improvements from the underlying Firebase Messaging SDK:\\n\\n- Android v23.0.0\\n- iOS v8.15.0\\n\\nThe OneSignal SDK has also been updated and now includes v4.7.3 on Android. \\n\\nThis update also brings a range of bug fixes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n![](images/admob.png)\\n\\n### Adverts\\n\\nVersion 13.6 brings version 9+ of the AdMob iOS SDK which includes some significant changes to the SDK. Most of the changes have been handled internal to the extension however there is one important piece of information that you must be aware of:\\n\\n\\n> **Ads stop serving on iOS 10**\\n> \\n> The minimum iOS version the Google Mobile Ads SDK version 9.0.0 supports is iOS 11.\\n>\\n> Upgrading to Google Mobile Ads SDK version 9.0.0 will not break your app on iOS 10 devices, however, no ads will be served on those devices.\\n>\\n\\nAdditionally mediator adapters have been updated to bring inline with this version of the AdMob SDKs.\\n\\n\\n#### Life Time Value (LTV)\\n\\nThis update also includes the preview implementation of the life time value events.\\n\\nMost of the adverts will now dispatch a `PaidEvent.PAID` event with information on the revenue obtained for presenting an advert. By implementing this event handler, you can use the data to calculate a user\'s life time value, or forward the data downstream to other relevant systems.\\n\\nMore information in the [Life Time Value](/docs/adverts/life-time-value) section.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n![](images/ironsource.png)\\n\\n### IronSource\\n\\nThe free ironSource extension has been updated to the latest version of the ironSource SDK:\\n\\n- Android v7.2.2\\n- iOS v7.2.2.1\\n\\nAdditionally all supported mediation adapters have been updated to be inline with this release of the ironSource SDK.\\n\\n:::info Sponsoring\\nIf you use this extension regularly we do ask that you consider sponsoring the development to allow us to continue updating the extension.

Previously these have had default values applied by the SDK but with Android 12 Google now requires us to define a specific value for this flag. If you are using APM then this should be a simple update call, otherwise we are updating all our documentation with the new manifest additions which you can apply when you move to targeting API 31.\\n\\nUpdating Google Play Services always is a big job for us. They reach into many of our extensions and all of them must be updated simultaneously to ensure they all work together. We have completed the Google Play Services updates internally and are working through our extensions to ensure compatibility and updating documentation as required.\\n\\n> Now is a great time to consider moving to apm before these updates arrive, in order to simplify your update process!

You should see a decent performance increase if you are dealing with large data queries.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs always, if you have any native development needs for AIR, Unity, Flutter or Haxe, please feel free to contact us at [airnativeextensions@distriqt.com](mailto:airnativeextensions@distriqt.com)."},{"id":"2021-08","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2021-08","source":"@site/news/2021-08-31-august-news.md","title":"August 2021","description":"APM, Adverts, Android 30, AIR Config","date":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 31, 2021","tags":[{"label":"newsletter","permalink":"/news/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"air","permalink":"/news/tags/air"},{"label":"apm","permalink":"/news/tags/apm"},{"label":"adverts","permalink":"/news/tags/adverts"},{"label":"android-30","permalink":"/news/tags/android-30"}],"readingTime":3.73,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Michael","title":"Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/marchbold","imageURL":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2021-08","title":"August 2021","description":"APM, Adverts, Android 30, AIR Config","image":"images/airpackagemanager.png","author":"Michael","author_title":"Lead Developer","author_url":"https://github.com/marchbold","author_image_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4","tags":["newsletter","air","apm","adverts","android-30"]},"prevItem":{"title":"September 2021","permalink":"/news/2021-09"},"nextItem":{"title":"July 2021","permalink":"/news/2021-07"}},"content":"> APM, Adverts and Android 30\\n\\nAnother big month, APM is moving along quickly and our first version of manifest merging has been added! We are super excited about this tool and the way it will change AIR development. I know a lot of the people we talk to emphasise the lack of quick integration being the biggest hurdle with AIR development and we believe this tool is almost ready to resolve that.\\n\\nOther updates include latest AdMob SDK and mediation networks. Flurry SDK has been updated and the new \\"standard events\\" added. CameraUI has had some major changes integrated to support Android 30, and the Scanner extension had some bug fixes released.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![](images/adobeair.png)\\n\\n### AIR SDK Configuration\\n\\nWhile working with apm we have been investigating options to make development using the AIR SDK easier and have come across some concerns around configuration of the SDK.\\n\\nBasically I\'m concerned about the configuration options for a project being placed inside the SDK. I believe this is a really bad practice and that we need to have a more consistent approach for configuration settings. I have raised our concerns on the AIR discussion forum and I think it\'s important as a community that we push a direction for Harman here, before they take the SDK down a bad path.\\n\\nPlease take the time to have a read and let Harman know about where you think the configuration options should be placed.\\n\\nYou can find the discussion here: [https://github.com/airsdk/Adobe-Runtime-Support/discussions/1112](https://github.com/airsdk/Adobe-Runtime-Support/discussions/1112)\\n\\n![](images/airpackagemanager.png)\\n\\n### [AIR Package Manager](https://github.com/airsdk/apm)\\n\\nWe have rolled out several more iterations of the `apm` tool and we have made amazing progress around generation of the application descriptor, most importantly the **automatic generation of the manifest additions for Android**.\\n\\nI seriously cannot emphasise enough how much this will change integrating packages in AIR applications.\\n\\nIt makes adding a new package (extension) to your application as easy as:\\n\\n```\\napm install com.distriqt.CameraUI\\napm generate app-descriptor\\n```\\n\\nAnd your application descriptor will automatically have the manifest additions and extension id\'s inserted, not only for the CameraUI extension but **all the dependencies**!\\n\\nThis is still a work in progress (eg we haven\'t completed iOS merging yet) and we are working hard on getting all our extensions available as packages, but we would really welcome any feedback.\\n\\nFor example, a basic app descriptor after running the above:\\n\\n```\\n<application xmlns=\\"http://ns.adobe.com/air/application/33.1\\">\\n  <id>com.my.app</id>\\n  <versionNumber>1.0.0</versionNumber>\\n  <filename>MyApplication</filename>\\n  <name>My Application</name>\\n  <initialWindow>\\n    <content>[]</content>\\n    <visible>true</visible>\\n    <fullScreen>false</fullScreen>\\n    <autoOrients>false</autoOrients>\\n    <renderMode>direct</renderMode>\\n  </initialWindow>\\n  <android>\\n    <manifestAdditions><![CDATA[<manifest android:installLocation=\\"auto\\" >\\n  <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\\"19\\" android:targetSdkVersion=\\"30\\"/>\\n  <uses-permission android:name=\\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\\"/>\\n  <uses-permission android:name=\\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\\"/>\\n  <application android:appComponentFactory=\\"androidx.core.app.CoreComponentFactory\\" android:hardwareAccelerated=\\"true\\">\\n    <provider android:name=\\"androidx.lifecycle.ProcessLifecycleOwnerInitializer\\" android:authorities=\\"air.com.my.app.lifecycle-process\\" android:exported=\\"false\\" android:multiprocess=\\"true\\"/>\\n    <provider android:name=\\"androidx.startup.InitializationProvider\\" android:authorities=\\"air.com.my.app.androidx-startup\\" android:exported=\\"false\\"/>\\n    <provider android:name=\\"com.distriqt.extension.cameraui.content.FileProvider\\" android:authorities=\\"air.com.my.app.camerauifileprovider\\" android:exported=\\"false\\" android:grantUriPermissions=\\"true\\">\\n      <meta-data android:name=\\"android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS\\" android:resource=\\"@xml/distriqt_cameraui_paths\\"/>\\n    </provider>\\n    <activity android:name=\\"com.distriqt.extension.cameraui.permissions.AuthorisationActivity\\" android:theme=\\"@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar\\"/>\\n  </application>\\n</manifest>\\n]]></manifestAdditions>\\n    <containsVideo>true</containsVideo>\\n  </android>\\n  <extensions>\\n    <extensionID>androidx.core</extensionID>\\n    <extensionID>com.distriqt.CameraUI</extensionID>\\n    <extensionID>com.distriqt.Core</extensionID>\\n  </extensions>\\n</application>\\n```\\n\\nCurrently we have the following air packages available:\\n\\n- All the Google Play Services\\n- All the androidx and android dependencies\\n- Square libs\\n- Camera UI\\n- Flurry\\n- Adverts (including mediators)\\n\\n#### Get Involved\\n\\nThis tool is for the community, so we really want your feedback. It is opensource and publicly available now. If you are at all interested in testing out the client we are looking for any and all feedback!

Additionally the UMP SDK has been updated to version 2.0.0.\\n\\nExcitingly this extension has been released as an airpackage. This means you can use `apm` to install and generate the manifest additions for you.\\n\\n```\\napm install com.distriqt.Adverts\\napm project config set adMobAndroidApplicationId XXXXXXX\\napm project config set adMobIOSApplicationId YYYYYYY\\n```\\n\\n![](images/android.png)\\n\\n### Android 30\\n\\nNow that the AIR SDK supports Android 30 we have been updating all our extensions to support this latest iteration of the Android platform. There are several major changes around opening and querying other installed packages and changes around file access that have affected some of our extensions, such as the CameraUI.\\n\\nIf you run into any issues, please let us know and we will make sure any issues are addressed promptly!\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs always, if you have any native development needs for AIR, Unity, Flutter or Haxe, please feel free to contact us at [airnativeextensions@distriqt.com](mailto:airnativeextensions@distriqt.com)."},{"id":"2021-07","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2021-07","source":"@site/news/2021-07-31-july-news.md","title":"July 2021","description":"APM, Dialog, ironSource","date":"2021-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 31, 2021","tags":[{"label":"newsletter","permalink":"/news/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"air","permalink":"/news/tags/air"},{"label":"apm","permalink":"/news/tags/apm"},{"label":"dialog","permalink":"/news/tags/dialog"},{"label":"ironsource","permalink":"/news/tags/ironsource"}],"readingTime":3.245,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Michael","title":"Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/marchbold","imageURL":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2021-07","title":"July 2021","description":"APM, Dialog, ironSource","image":"images/airpackagemanager.png","author":"Michael","author_title":"Lead Developer","author_url":"https://github.com/marchbold","author_image_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4","tags":["newsletter","air","apm","dialog","ironsource"]},"prevItem":{"title":"August 2021","permalink":"/news/2021-08"},"nextItem":{"title":"June 2021","permalink":"/news/2021-06"}},"content":"> APM, Dialog, ironSource \\n\\nWhat an exciting month for AIR!

We believe this is such an important missing component of the AIR eco-system that we are pushing ahead with the development. \\n\\n>\\n> The AIR Package Manager allows management of AIR libraries and extensions and assists in creation of the application descriptor.\\n>\\n\\nInitially we have just been scoping the components and planning the development but will be moving into development in May.\\n\\nHave a look at the [repository](https://github.com/airsdk/apm) and if you have any thoughts and feel you could help please reach out, either by [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/marchbold) or contributing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n![](images/game-controller.png)\\n\\n\\n### Game Controller\\n\\nWe have had a few requests around improving the game controller support in AIR on mobile. \\n\\n> This will allow us to create a new \\"Game Controller\\" ANE to provide advanced features and events from controllers on iOS and Android. Features would include: connected / disconnected events, input buttons / axis events, and retrieving controller information such as such as type / provider / vendor.\\n\\nYou can read the discussion [here](https://forum.starling-framework.org/d/23008-gamepad-controller-support-iosandroid/18)\\n\\nSponsoring helps us to fund the initial development work for a new extension and is the simplest way we can continue further development of the AIR platform. We have had a large contribution to the development but are still looking for additional funding to get this extension started. If you are interested you can sponsor the development on [github](https://github.com/sponsors/distriqt).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n![](images/unity.png)\\n\\n\\n### [Unity Plugins](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/46451)\\n\\nWe have released another plugin to the Unity Asset Store this month:\\n\\n- [NFC](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/nfc-190517) \\n\\nScan NFC tags and launch your application to engage users physically with the real world! \\n\\nCheck all our Unity plugins out in the [store](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/46451).
