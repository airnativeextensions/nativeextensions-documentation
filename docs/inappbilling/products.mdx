At the core of the InAppBilling functionality is a list of products. 
Before making any purchases or restoring any transactions you must retrieve a list of the 
products you support in your application from the payment service by calling the **get products** method.

This will initialise the list of products available, retrieving information about the product such as: 
- price, 
- title, 
- description etc.

Generally we advise immediately retrieving this list as soon as the service is setup, 
however you can make this call wherever you see fit, as long as it is done before any 
purchase operations are attempted.

If there are any invalid product codes in the specified array the **invalid product** event will be dispatched. 
This error occurs when there was an invalid product ID requested. 
If this error occurs you should check that you have correctly specified a product ID and that it matches an ID that was setup in the store. 

In this event there will be one product in the event indicating the invalid product ID. You should not display invalid products to your user. 

When this operation completes successfully the **products loaded** event be dispatched.  The data in the event contains an array of the successfully loaded products.

When this operation fails the **products failed** event be dispatched. 
When this happens you are advised to wait a small interval and retry the call. 
You may also wish to check if the user has a valid network connection using the 
[NetworkInfo](http://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.NetworkInfo) 
or other such method and inform the user of the problem.



<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="air" values={[
    {label: 'AIR', value: 'air'},
    {label: 'Unity', value: 'unity'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="air" >

To retrieve the list of products you call `getProducts()` with an array of product ids eg `com.distriqt.testProduct`.

```actionscript
InAppBilling.service.getProducts( 
	[ `com.distriqt.testProduct` ]
);
```

This call will dispatch one of the following events:
- `ProductEvent.PRODUCTS_LOADED`: Dispatched when the products have been retrieved successfully
- `ProductEvent.PRODUCTS_FAILED`: Dispatched when there was an error
- `ProductEvent.INVALID_PRODUCT`: Dispatched when there was an invalid product ID requested

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="unity">

To retrieve the list of products you call `GetProducts()` with an array of product ids eg `com.distriqt.testProduct`.

```csharp	
InAppBilling.Instance.GetProducts( 
	new List<string> { "com.distriqt.testProduct" }
);
```

This call will dispatch one of the following events:
- `InAppBilling.Instance.Events.OnGetProductsSuccess`: Dispatched when the products have been retrieved successfully
- `InAppBilling.Instance.Events.OnGetProductsFailed`: Dispatched when there was an error
- `InAppBilling.Instance.Events.OnInvalidProduct`: Dispatched when there was an invalid product ID requested

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


More than likely you will have more than one product in your application 
so you must pass all of your product ids to this function.


## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are treated slightly differently internally so we need to specify the list 
of subscription product ids separately from the single purchase products.

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="air" values={[
    {label: 'AIR', value: 'air'},
    {label: 'Unity', value: 'unity'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="air" >

If you have subscriptions in your application you need to pass a second array of 
ids to the `getProducts()` method, for example:

```actionscript
InAppBilling.service.getProducts( 
	[ `com.distriqt.testProduct` ],
	[ `com.distriqt.testSubscription` ] 
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="unity">

If you have subscriptions in your application you need to pass a second array of 
ids to the `GetProducts()` method, for example:

```csharp	
InAppBilling.Instance.GetProducts( 
	new List<string> { "com.distriqt.testProduct" },
	new List<string> { "com.distriqt.testSubscription" }
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

A subscription product may contain information about the subscription period. This is only supported through stores that return this information.
Some stores assume you "know" this information (eg Apple In-App Purchasing) and don't return the information. 

If it is available `product.subscriptionPeriod` will be a valid instance of the `SubscriptionPeriod` class. If it is unavailable the `subscriptionPeriod` will be `null`.

This class contains two properties:

- `numberOfUnits`: The number of units per subscription period
- `unit`: The increment of time that a subscription period is specified in (available values are defined in the class eg : `SubscriptionPeriod.UNIT_DAY`)

For example, if the `numberOfUnits` was `2` and the `unit` was  `SubscriptionPeriod.UNIT_WEEK` then the subscription payment recurs every 2 weeks (fortnightly). Or if the `numberOfUnits` was `3` and the `unit` was  `SubscriptionPeriod.UNIT_MONTH`, then the payment recurs every 3 months (or quarterly).


### Subscription Group 

Some stores allow you to group subscriptions together allowing different subscription products to provide the same subscription benefits. 

If the service returns this information the `product.subscriptionGroupId` will be a valid string containing the subscription group ID. If it is not available the `subscriptionGroupId` will be an empty string.


:::::note Supported Platforms
The subscription group ID is supported on the following services:
- iOS StoreKit

Even though subscription groups are supported on Google Play Billing, the subscription group ID is not returned by the service.

## Subscription Offers

A `Product` that represents a subscription will contain information about available offers for the subscription. 

See the section on [Subscription Offers](subscription-offers) and [Introductory Prices](introductory-prices.md) for more information.



## Example code

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="air" values={[
    {label: 'AIR', value: 'air'},
    {label: 'Unity', value: 'unity'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="air" >

The following demonstrates calling `setup` and then `getProducts` on setup success:

```actionscript
var products : Array;
var productIds : Array = [ "com.distriqt.testProduct1", "com.distriqt.testProduct2" ];
var subscriptionIds : Array = [ "com.distriqt.testSubscription1", "com.distriqt.testSubscription2" ];

InAppBilling.service.addEventListener( InAppBillingEvent.SETUP_SUCCESS, setup_successHandler );
InAppBilling.service.addEventListener( InAppBillingEvent.SETUP_FAILURE, setup_failureHandler );

InAppBilling.service.addEventListener( ProductEvent.PRODUCTS_LOADED, products_loadedHandler );
InAppBilling.service.addEventListener( ProductEvent.PRODUCTS_FAILED, products_failedHandler );
InAppBilling.service.addEventListener( ProductEvent.INVALID_PRODUCT, product_invalidHandler );

InAppBilling.service.setup(
        new BillingService()
                .setGooglePlayPublicKey( GOOGLE_PLAY_INAPP_BILLING_KEY )
);




function setup_successHandler( event:InAppBillingEvent ):void
{
	// Retrieve the product list
	InAppBilling.service.getProducts( productIds, subscriptionIds );
}

function products_loadedHandler( event:ProductEvent ):void
{
	// event.products will be an Array of Product instances for each product and subscription successfully loaded
	for each (var product:Product in event.products)
	{
		trace( product.toString() );
	}
	products = event.products;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="unity">

The following demonstrates calling `Setup` and then `GetProducts` on setup success:

```csharp
var products : List<Product>;
var productIds : List<string> = new List<string> { "com.distriqt.testProduct1", "com.distriqt.testProduct2" };
var subscriptionIds : List<string> = new List<string> { "com.distriqt.testSubscription1", "com.distriqt.testSubscription2" };

InAppBilling.Instance.Events.OnGetProductsSuccess += ProductsLoadedHandler;
InAppBilling.Instance.Events.OnGetProductsFailed += ProductsFailedHandler;
InAppBilling.Instance.Events.OnInvalidProduct += InvalidProductHandler;

InAppBilling.Instance.Setup(
	new BillingService(),
	(e) =>
	{
		if (e.type == InAppBillingEvent.SETUP_SUCCESS)
		{
			// Retrieve the product list
			InAppBilling.Instance.GetProducts( productIds, subscriptionIds );
		}
		else
		{
			Debug.LogError("Setup failed: " + e.errorCode + " " + e.message);
		}
	}
);

private void ProductsLoadedHandler(ProductEvent e)
{
	// event.products will be an Array of Product instances for each product and subscription successfully loaded
	foreach (Product product in e.products)
	{
		Debug.Log(product.ToString());
	}
	products = e.products;
}

private void ProductsFailedHandler(ProductEvent e)
{
	Debug.LogError("GetProducts failed: " + e.errorCode + " " + e.message);
}

private void InvalidProductHandler(ProductEvent e)
{
	Debug.LogError("Invalid product: " + e.products[0].id);
}
```
