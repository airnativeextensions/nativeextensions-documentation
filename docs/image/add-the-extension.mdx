The simplest way to install and manage your AIR native extensions and libraries is to use the AIR Package Manager (`apm`). We highly recommend using `apm`, as it will handle downloading all required dependencies and manage your application descriptor (Android manifest additions, iOS info additions etc).

However you can choose to install it manually, as you would have done in the past. 

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<InstallAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<InstallManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>



## Checking for Support

You should check whether the extension is supported before making calls with the `isSupported` property.
This allows you to react to whether the functionality is available on the device.

We always implement this function to allow you to dynamically switch functionality and fallback to other methods if the extension is not supported on the current platform and version.


```actionscript
if (Image.isSupported)
{
	//	Functionality here
}
```
