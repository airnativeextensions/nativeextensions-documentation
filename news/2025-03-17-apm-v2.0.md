**APM Now Supports Linux: Expanded Capabilities and Key Updates**

Great news for developers! APM has been updated to fully support Linux operating systems. This means you can now use APM to install and manage libraries, extensions, and application descriptors in Linux-based development environments. This long-awaited feature enhances APM’s versatility and makes it even more accessible to a broader range of developers.

- **Feature:** Improved error reporting by adding descriptions of parameters that caused app-descriptor generation failures (Resolves [#188](https://github.com/airsdk/apm/issues/188)).
- **Bug Fix:** Resolved an issue where configuration settings were being removed after a package update (Resolves [#209](https://github.com/airsdk/apm/issues/209)).
- **Android Updates:**
  - Updated the manifest merge client to version 31.9.0.
  - Fixed an issue where Java output from manifest merging was causing XML errors (Resolves [#164](https://github.com/airsdk/apm/issues/164)).
  - Added the ability to pass through “tools” requests to the app descriptor, ensuring proper handling during ADT packaging (Resolves [#219](https://github.com/airsdk/apm/issues/219)).
