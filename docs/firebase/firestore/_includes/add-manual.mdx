The following guide is used to manually install the extension, download dependencies and update the application descriptor. We highly recommend installing extensions using `apm`. Using `apm` will automate the installation and automatically handle updates and dependencies along with greatly simplifying the application descriptor generation.
:::


First step is always to add the extension to your development environment. 

:::caution Firebase Core
You must have gone through the setup of the Firebase Core extension before attempting to proceed with this extension.

Make sure you have added all the extensions required for the Firebase Core extension as outlined [here](../../core/add-the-extensions.mdx).

### Firebase Cloud Firestore

The main additional extension is the Firestore ANE, however you must add the Auth and Database extensions as well:

- [`com.distriqt.firebase.Firestore`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Firebase/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.firebase.Firestore.ane)
- [`com.distriqt.firebase.Database`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Firebase/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.firebase.Database.ane)
- [`com.distriqt.firebase.Auth`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Firebase/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.firebase.Auth.ane)


Download the extension from the repository and then follow the tutorial located [here](/docs/tutorials/getting-started) to add the extension to your development environment.


#### Android Support

The Android Support libraries encompass the Android Support, Android X and common Google libraries. 

These libraries are specific to Android. There are no issues including these on all platforms, they are just **required** for Android.

This extension requires the following extensions:

- [`com.google.protobuflite`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.google.protobuflite.ane)
- [`android.browser`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.google.android.recaptcha.ane)
- [`com.google.android.recaptcha`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.google.android.recaptcha.ane)

You can access these extensions here: [https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport).




#### Google Play Services

This ANE requires usage of certain aspects of the Google Play Services client library. 
The client library is available as a series of ANEs that you add into your applications packaging options. 
Each separate ANE provides a component from the Play Services client library and are used by different ANEs. 
These client libraries aren't packaged with this ANE as they are used by multiple ANEs and separating them 
will avoid conflicts, allowing you to use multiple ANEs in the one application.

This ANE requires the following Google Play Services:

- [`com.distriqt.playservices.Auth`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-GooglePlayServices/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.playservices.Auth.ane)

You must include the above native extensions in your application along with this extension, 
and you need to ensure they are packaged with your application.

You can access the Google Play Services client library extensions here: [https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-GooglePlayServices](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-GooglePlayServices).



### Square ANEs

Due to several of our ANE's using the [Square open source libraries](http://square.github.io/) the libraries have been separated into a separate ANEs allowing you to avoid conflicts and duplicate definitions. This means that you need to include the some of the square native extensions in your application along with this extension.

You will add these extensions as you do with any other ANE, and you need to ensure it is packaged with your application.

This ANE requires the following Square extensions:

- [`com.distriqt.square.okhttp`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-SquareLibs/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.square.okhttp.ane)

You can access these extensions here: [https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-SquareLibs](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-SquareLibs).



### Guava

Add the `com.google.guava` extension which adds support for Google Guava libraries in the application. This extension is available in the Android support repository:

- [`com.google.guava`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.google.guava.ane)


### gRPC

Add the `io.grpc` extension which adds support for gRPC libraries in the application. This extension is available in the Android support repository:

- [`io.grpc`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/io.grpc.ane)
