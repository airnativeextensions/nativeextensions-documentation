## Setup Change

There has been a slight change to the setup call, it will now perform a check if the user has previously 
signed in successfully and start a silent sign in process. This ensures the `isSignedIn` flag is correct
after setup. 

Notes:
- this makes the setup process asynchronous if you want to ensure the `isSignedIn` flag is correct
- may present a UI ("signing you in") on Android if the user has signed in previously
- can disable this new functionality by setting `options.attemptSilentSignIn = false;`

### Updates

feat(android): add ability to automatically perform silent sign in at setup if previously signed in
feat(ios): clean up sign in process at setup
feat: add attemptSilentSignIn parameter to options to control auto sign in attempt at setup
feat(android): update androidx credentials sdk to v1.5.0
