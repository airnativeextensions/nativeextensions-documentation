> InAppBilling v17.1.0 - Major Overhaul for Google Play + Samsung IAP  

[Release notes Â»](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-InAppBilling/releases/tag/v17.1.0)

This is a **critical update**, especially for Android developers. It brings support for **Google Play Billing v7** - and since **Google is enforcing API 35 starting August 2025**, this update is **required** for ongoing app submissions and updates.

- **Samsung IAP upgraded to SDK v6.4.0**: Purchases now require acknowledgment via `finishPurchase()`.
- **EU compliance support**: Added `isOfferPersonalised` flag to comply with GDPR.
- **Subscription improvements**:
  - Installment plans (`SubscriptionInstallmentPlan`)
  - Pending update info during plan changes
  - iOS fallback URLs for subscription management
- **Unity builds fully supported** for these new features
