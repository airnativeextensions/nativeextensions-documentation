:::info About
Huawei AppGallery is Huawei official Android Application store.

Huawei In-App Purchases (IAP) aggregates multiple payment methods for global payments, and can be easily integrated into your app to help you increase revenue. Using IAP, you can sell a variety of products or services, including digital goods and subscriptions, directly within your app.

:::warning Google
Huawei devices use a variant of Android. Some may include both Google Play and the Huawei AppGallery so you may need to support both.

This section describes how to setup your AIR application to use Huawei In-App Purchases with this extension.


import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

import InstallAPM from './_includes/add-apm.mdx'
import InstallManual from './_includes/add-manual.mdx'

import AppDescriptorAPM from './_includes/add-apm-appdescriptor.mdx'
import AppDescriptorManual from './_includes/add-manual-appdescriptor.mdx'


## Install

The simplest way to install and manage your AIR native extensions and libraries is to use the AIR Package Manager (`apm`). We highly recommend using `apm`, as it will handle downloading all required dependencies and manage your application descriptor (Android manifest additions, iOS info additions etc).

However you can choose to install it manually, as you would have done in the past. 

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<InstallAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<InstallManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>


## Application Descriptor

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<AppDescriptorAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<AppDescriptorManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>



## Checking for Support

You can use the `isSupported` flag to determine if this extension is supported on the current platform and device.

This allows you to react to whether the functionality is available on the device and provide an alternative solution if not.


```actionscript
if (InAppBilling.isSupported)
{
	// Functionality here
}
```

:::note 
This only checks if there is some functionality supported, not whether a particular billing service is available.
