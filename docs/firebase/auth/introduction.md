## About

> 
> Most apps need to know the identity of a user. Knowing a user's identity allows an app to securely 
> save user data in the cloud and provide the same personalized experience across all of the user's devices.
> 
> Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. 
> It supports authentication using passwords, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.
> 
> Firebase Authentication integrates tightly with other Firebase services, and it leverages 
> industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, so it can be easily integrated with your custom backend.

## Key capabilities

### Firebase UI 

Coming soon 

> 
> Easily add a complete sign-in system to your app. FirebaseUI provides a drop-in auth solution 
> that handles the UI flows for signing in users with email addresses and passwords, Google Sign-In, 
> and Facebook Login.
> 
> The FirebaseUI Auth component implements best practices for authentication on mobile devices 
> and websites, which can maximize sign-in and sign-up conversion for your app. 
> It also handles edge cases like account recovery and account linking that can be security 
> sensitive and error-prone to handle correctly. 
>
> FirebaseUI can be easily customized to fit in with the rest of your app's visual style, 
> and it is open source, so you aren't constrained in realizing the user experience you want. 
> 


### Email and password based authentication 

>
> Authenticate users with their email addresses and passwords. 
>
> The Firebase Authentication SDK provides methods to create and manage users that use their 
> email addresses and passwords to sign in. Firebase Authentication also handles sending password 
> reset emails. 
>


### Identity provider integration 

>
> Authenticate users by integrating with federated identity providers. 
> The Firebase Authentication SDK provides methods that allow users to sign in with their Google,
> Facebook, Twitter, and GitHub accounts. 
>


### Anonymous auth

>
> Use Firebase features that require authentication without requiring users to sign in first by 
> creating temporary anonymous accounts. If the user later chooses to sign up, you can upgrade 
> the anonymous account to a regular account, so the user can continue where they left off.
