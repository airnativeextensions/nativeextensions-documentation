## Billing Service

Before starting here you should make sure you have already setup the service for your application 
as outlined in earlier sections. 
This is where you would have added products to your application in the appropriate developer console.

The next step to using the functionality in this extension is to setup a billing (or purchasing) service. 
This simply requires you to set the service you plan on using and calling `setup()` with any service configuration required.

The following uses the default service for the current device and specifies the Google Play Billing Public License key:

```actionscript
var service:BillingService = new BillingService()
    .setGooglePlayPublicKey( GOOGLE_PLAY_INAPP_BILLING_KEY );

var success:Boolean = InAppBilling.service.setup( service );
```

This call performs a few things internally 

- Initialises the billing service
- Initialises the purchase queue 
- Adds appropriate native purchase handlers
- Checks the state of any pending purchases

The return value of the `setup()` function indicates if the configured service type is supported on 
the current device. This may return `false` if you have for example requests Apple In-App Purchases on
an Android device. 

Once this is complete the `InAppBillingEvent.SETUP_SUCCESS` event will be dispatched and the service
is available for queries.

If an error occurred then the `InAppBillingEvent.SETUP_FAILURE` event will be dispatched. This is a fatal
event and will stop any other functionality from working successfully. Generally this only occurs due 
to a misconfiguration and is to help you get an application working correctly however you should make 
sure that you handle the event appropriately.


## Events

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="air" values={[
    {label: 'AIR', value: 'air'},
    {label: 'Unity', value: 'unity'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="air" >
  
We suggest you listen to the following four events before calling setup:

- `InAppBillingEvent.SETUP_SUCCESS`: Dispatched when setup is successfully completed;
- `InAppBillingEvent.SETUP_FAILURE`: Dispatched when there was an error during setup;
- `PurchaseEvent.PURCHASES_UPDATED`: Dispatched if there are pending purchases needing to be processed;
- `PurchaseRequestEvent.SHOULD_ADD_PURCHASE`: Dispatched if the app was launched from an AppStore promotional purchase (see [Promotions](promotions)).


```actionscript
InAppBilling.service.addEventListener( PurchaseEvent.PURCHASES_UPDATED, purchases_updatedHandler );
InAppBilling.service.addEventListener( PurchaseRequestEvent.SHOULD_ADD_PURCHASE, purchaseRequest_shouldAddPurchaseHandler );
						
InAppBilling.service.setup(
        new BillingService()
                .setGooglePlayPublicKey( GOOGLE_PLAY_INAPP_BILLING_KEY )
);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unity" >

We suggest you listen to the following four events before calling setup:

- `InAppBilling.Instance.Events.OnPurchasesUpdated`: Dispatched if there are pending purchases needing to be processed;
- `InAppBilling.Instance.Events.OnShouldAddPurchase`: Dispatched if the app was launched from an AppStore promotional purchase (see [Promotions](promotions));

```csharp
InAppBilling.Instance.Events.OnPurchasesUpdated += OnPurchasesUpdated;
InAppBilling.Instance.Events.OnShouldAddPurchase += OnShouldAddPurchase;

InAppBilling.Instance.Setup(
        new BillingService()
            .SetGooglePlayPublicKey( GOOGLE_PLAY_INAPP_BILLING_KEY )
);                
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Service Type

The billing service type will be automatically selected based on the default of the current device platform. However we suggest you specify the service type in your `BillingService` using `setServiceType()` to specify a particular service:

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="air" values={[
    {label: 'AIR', value: 'air'},
    {label: 'Unity', value: 'unity'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="air" >

```actionscript
var service:BillingService = new BillingService(  )
    .setServiceType( InAppBillingServiceTypes.GOOGLE_PLAY_INAPP_BILLING )
    .setGooglePlayPublicKey( GOOGLE_PLAY_INAPP_BILLING_KEY );

var success:Boolean = InAppBilling.service.setup( service );
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="unity" >

```csharp
var service = new BillingService()
    .SetServiceType( InAppBillingServiceTypes.GOOGLE_PLAY_INAPP_BILLING )
    .SetGooglePlayPublicKey( GOOGLE_PLAY_INAPP_BILLING_KEY );
InAppBilling.Instance.Setup( service );
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::note 
You do not need to call `setServiceType()`. 
If you do not call it then the default for the current platform will be used, 
i.e. Apple InApp Purchases on iOS and Google's Play InApp Billing on Android.

We suggest that you do specify a service type, particularly on Android where there are multiple stores involved.
This is so that you ensure you are utilising the correct store for your application, otherwise you may find that the extension incorrectly assumes you are using the default store on the device (eg Huawei AppGallery on a Huawei device), which may not be what you intend.
:::


## Availability

Once you have completed setup it is important to check whether the user on the current device can make payments. There are certain factors that can limit the functionality which can have consequences for all product and purchasing functionality.

For example, the latest version of Play Billing is only supported with an updated version of the Play Store app. If an older version is on the user's device the billing api will not be available.


<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="air" values={[
    {label: 'AIR', value: 'air'},
    {label: 'Unity', value: 'unity'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="air" >

To check the status call the `checkAvailability()` function and await the result. This function will dispatch an `AvailabilityEvent.COMPLETE` event or call a callback function passed as the parameter to the function.

Callback:

```actionscript
InAppBilling.service.checkAvailability(
        function ( availability:String ):void
        {
            trace( "availability = " + availability );
        }
);
```

Event:

```actionscript
InAppBilling.service.addEventListener( AvailabilityEvent.COMPLETE, function( event:AvailabilityEvent ):void
{
    trace( "availability = " + event.availability );
});
InAppBilling.service.checkAvailability();
```



The `availability` value will be one of the values defined in the `InAppBillingAvailability` class:

- `InAppBillingAvailability.AVAILABLE`: Service is available for products and purchases;
- `InAppBillingAvailability.NOT_AVAILABLE`: Service is unavailable on the device;
- `InAppBillingAvailability.STORE_UPGRADE_REQUIRED`: An update is required to the store application for this service



</TabItem>
<TabItem value="unity" >


To check the status call the `CheckAvailability()` function and await the result. 

```csharp
InAppBilling.Instance.CheckAvailability(
        (e) =>
        {
            Debug.Log( "availability = " + e.availability );
        }
);
```
The `e.availability` value will be one of the values defined in the `InAppBillingAvailability` class:

- `InAppBillingAvailability.AVAILABLE`: Service is available for products and purchases;
- `InAppBillingAvailability.NOT_AVAILABLE`: Service is unavailable on the device;
- `InAppBillingAvailability.STORE_UPGRADE_REQUIRED`: An update is required to the store application for this service;

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should handle the response as required and inform your users if purchasing isn't available or steps to upgrade the store application.


:::note
If you don't check for the availability you will find certain aspects of the extension will fail. For example, if a store upgrade is required you will likely get failed events from functions like `getProducts()` with the error code `FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED`. 

It is equally appropriate to handle those error events however we suggest an upfront approach using this function can provide a better user experience.

## Pending Purchases

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="air" values={[
    {label: 'AIR', value: 'air'},
    {label: 'Unity', value: 'unity'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="air" >

Note that the pending purchases may not be available to you at the  `InAppBillingEvent.SETUP_SUCCESS` event, as they may be updated after setup has completed. 
This is particularly true on iOS/tvOS where the payment queue update (which populates the pending purchases) will occur a short time after setup succeeds.

This update will be indicated by a `PurchaseEvent.PURCHASES_UPDATED`, indicating there are purchases to process.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="unity" >

Note that the pending purchases may not be available to you after setup is complete, as they may be updated after this point. 
This is particularly true on iOS/tvOS where the payment queue update (which populates the pending purchases) will occur a short time after setup succeeds.

This update will be indicated by an `OnPurchasesUpdated` event, indicating there are purchases to process.

</TabItem>
