title: Migrating to v11.0

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'


## Changes

With the deprecation of Firebase Dynamic Links you will need to change the way you handle email link authentication as you will no longer receive the `DynamicLinkEvent.RECEIVED` event. 

You should remove the Firebase Dynamic Links extension from your application as it is no longer required for email link authentication.

See the auth [migration guide](auth/migrating-to-v11.mdx) for more information on migrating to the new email link authentication method. 



## New Features 

Support has been added to the remote config extension for update events which will be dispatched when the server notifies the application of an update to the configuration settings. 
Additionally we have added the `activate` and `fetch` methods, allowing you to fetch and activate remote config parameters in a single call.

- [Update events](remoteconfig/usage.md#listen-for-updates)

Added attributes to traces for the Performance extension. This allows you to add custom attributes to traces.

- [Attributes](performance/traces.md#attributes)

We have added the ability to change the default sort order for queries in the Firestore extension.

- [Change default sort order](firestore/order-and-limit-data.md#default-order)
