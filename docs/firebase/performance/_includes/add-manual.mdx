The following guide is used to manually install the extension, download dependencies and update the application descriptor. We highly recommend installing extensions using `apm`. Using `apm` will automate the installation and automatically handle updates and dependencies along with greatly simplifying the application descriptor generation.

First step is always to add the extension to your development environment. 

:::caution Firebase Core
You must have gone through the setup of the Firebase Core extension before attempting to proceed with this extension.

Make sure you have added all the extensions required for the Firebase Core extension as outlined [here](../../core/add-the-extensions.mdx).

### Firebase Performance

The main additional extension is the Performance ANE, however you must add the Remote Config extension as well:

- [`com.distriqt.firebase.Performance`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Firebase/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.firebase.Performance.ane)
- [`com.distriqt.firebase.RemoteConfig`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Firebase/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.firebase.RemoteConfig.ane)


Download the extension from the repository and then follow the tutorial located [here](/docs/tutorials/getting-started) to add the extension to your development environment.


### Android Support

The Android Support libraries encompass the Android Support, Android X and common Google libraries. 

These libraries are specific to Android. There are no issues including these on all platforms, they are just **required** for Android.

This extension requires the following extensions:

- [`androidx.appcompat`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.appcompat.ane)
- [`androidx.datastore`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.datastore.ane)
- [`androidx.vectordrawable`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.vectordrawable.ane)
- [`com.google.android.datatransport`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.google.android.datatransport.ane)
- [`com.google.dagger`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.google.dagger.ane)
- [`com.google.protobuflite`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.google.protobuflite.ane)

You can access these extensions here: [https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport).



### Square ANEs

Due to several of our ANE's using the [Square open source libraries](http://square.github.io/) the libraries have been separated into a separate ANEs allowing you to avoid conflicts and duplicate definitions. This means that you need to include the some of the square native extensions in your application along with this extension.

You will add these extensions as you do with any other ANE, and you need to ensure it is packaged with your application.

This ANE requires the following Square extensions:

- [`com.distriqt.square.okhttp3`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-SquareLibs/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.square.okhttp3.ane)

You can access these extensions here: [https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-SquareLibs](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-SquareLibs).
