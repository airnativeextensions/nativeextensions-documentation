The following guide is used to manually install the extension, download dependencies and update the application descriptor. We highly recommend installing extensions using `apm`. Using `apm` will automate the installation and automatically handle updates and dependencies along with greatly simplifying the application descriptor generation.

The `com.distriqt.admob.Pangle` ANE includes the Unity Ads SDK and the AdMob Unity Ads mediation adapter. This is everything you need to get Unity Ads mediation working in your application.

To add the ANE download it from the repository and add it to your application:

- [`com.distriqt.admob.Pangle`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Adverts-Mediation/raw/master/lib/unityads/com.distriqt.admob.Pangle.ane)
