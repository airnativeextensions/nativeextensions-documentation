The following guide is used to manually install the extension, download dependencies and update the application descriptor. We highly recommend installing extensions using `apm`. Using `apm` will automate the installation and automatically handle updates and dependencies along with greatly simplifying the application descriptor generation.

First step is always to add the extension to your development environment. 

:::caution Firebase Core
You must have gone through the setup of the Firebase Core extension before attempting to proceed with this extension.

Make sure you have added all the extensions required for the Firebase Core extension as outlined [here](../../core/add-the-extensions.mdx).
:::


### Firebase Auth

The main additional extension is the Auth ANE located here:

- [`com.distriqt.firebase.Auth`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Firebase/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.firebase.Auth.ane)

Download the extension from the repository and then follow the tutorial located [here](/docs/tutorials/getting-started) to add the extension to your development environment.

This extension contains all the required libraries for the main Firebase authentication functionality, however some of the authentication providers (such as Facebook and Google) may require additional extensions. We list these in the documentation in each of the specific providers so you only include the required extensions for your situation.



### Android Support

The Android Support libraries encompass the Android Support, Android X and common Google libraries. 

These libraries are specific to Android. There are no issues including these on all platforms, they are just **required** for Android.

This extension requires the following extensions:

- [`androidx.browser`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.browser.ane)
- [`com.google.android.recaptcha`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.google.android.recaptcha.ane)

You can access these extensions here: [https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport).



#### Google Play Services

This ANE requires usage of certain aspects of the Google Play Services client library. 
The client library is available as a series of ANEs that you add into your applications packaging options. 
Each separate ANE provides a component from the Play Services client library and are used by different ANEs. 
These client libraries aren't packaged with this ANE as they are used by multiple ANEs and separating them 
will avoid conflicts, allowing you to use multiple ANEs in the one application.

This ANE requires the following Google Play Services:

- [`com.distriqt.playservices.Auth`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-GooglePlayServices/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.playservices.Auth.ane)

You must include the above native extensions in your application along with this extension, 
and you need to ensure they are packaged with your application.

You can access the Google Play Services client library extensions here: [https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-GooglePlayServices](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-GooglePlayServices).

>
> **Note:** The Google Play Services and Android Support ANEs are only **required** on Android devices. 
> There is no problem packaging these ANEs with all platforms as there are default implementations available which will allow your code to package without errors 
> however if you are only building an iOS application feel free to remove the Google Play Services ANEs from your application.
