### Extension IDs

The following should be added to your `extensions` node in your application descriptor to identify all the required ANEs in your application:

```xml
<extensions>
    <extensionID>com.distriqt.Image</extensionID>
    <extensionID>com.distriqt.Core</extensionID>
    <extensionID>androidx.core</extensionID>
</extensions>
```



### Android

#### Manifest Additions

In order for the extension to request permissions to save images to the camera roll you must 
add the following to your manifest additions:

```xml
<manifest android:installLocation="auto">
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
	
	<application>
		<activity android:name="com.distriqt.core.auth.AuthorisationActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar" android:exported="false" />
	</application>
	
</manifest>
```


### iOS

#### InfoAdditions

The following additions are for the `InfoAdditions` node of the iPhone section in your application descriptor:

```xml
<iPhone>
	<InfoAdditions><![CDATA[

		HERE

	]]></InfoAdditions>
</iPhone>
```


If you are using iOS 10+ you now need to add some strings to display messages to the user 
when certain permissions are requested. If you are sharing images then there is a chance 
the user may select to save to their camera roll in which case the following is displayed 
the first time your user attempts to access the camera roll.

![](../images/ios-permission-dialog.png)

There are 2 keys required here that control the text in this dialog:

```xml
	<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Access to photo library is required to save images.</string>
	<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Access to photo library is required to save images.</string>
```

The second key was added in iOS 11.2. You should add both keys to your info additions.
