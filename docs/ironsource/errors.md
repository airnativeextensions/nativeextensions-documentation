ironSource provides an error code mechanism to help you understand errors you may run into during integration or live production. Extract the error data from the Event object as follows:

```actionscript
var errorCode:String;
var errorDescription:String;
                
if(event.data)
{
   var error:Object = JSON.parse(event.data);
   errorDescription = error.error_description;
   errorCode = error.error_code;
}
```

## Error Codes

ironSource provides an error feedback mechanism to provide explanation for any failure in the SDK integration.
You will receive these errors when something went wrong or an aspect of the integration wasnâ€™t completed correctly.

The ironSource Error object contains an error code and message. 
These are all the possible errors and their message based on their functions:
