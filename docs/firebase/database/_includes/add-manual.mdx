The following guide is used to manually install the extension, download dependencies and update the application descriptor. We highly recommend installing extensions using `apm`. Using `apm` will automate the installation and automatically handle updates and dependencies along with greatly simplifying the application descriptor generation.

First step is always to add the extension to your development environment.

The main additional extension is the Realtime Database ANE, however you must add the [Auth extension](../../auth/add-the-extensions.mdx):

- [`com.distriqt.firebase.Database`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Firebase/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.firebase.Database.ane)

Download the extension from the repository and then follow the tutorial located [here](/docs/tutorials/getting-started) to add the extension to your development environment.


### Android Support

The Android Support libraries encompass the Android Support, Android X and common Google libraries. 

These libraries are specific to Android. There are no issues including these on all platforms, they are just **required** for Android.

This extension requires the following extensions:

- [`com.google.guava`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.google.guava.ane)
