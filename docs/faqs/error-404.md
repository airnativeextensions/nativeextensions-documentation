If you have purchased the extension and you are getting a 404 error when browsing to the repository you may have to accept an invitation to our GitHub organisation. This is a step required by GitHub before we can give you access to the private repositories.

Either check your GitHub email address for an invitation or browse to:

[https://github.com/distriqt](https://github.com/distriqt)

and accept the invitation.
