# Native Maps

The [Native Maps](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.NativeMaps) allows you to display native iOS Apple maps and Android Google maps with interactivity and overlays in your applications. 

This allows you to provide high performance mapping applications well integrated with your AIR application. Select between normal, hybrid and satellite map types and control the view setting positions, bounds, zoom and tilt.

You can add markers and draw custom overlays using polylines etc and you can draw the map to a bitmap if you require to animate the map in AIR.

The simple API allows you to quickly integrate high performance mapping solution in your AIR application in just a few lines of code.
