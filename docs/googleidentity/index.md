# Google Identity / Google SignIn

The [Google Identity](http://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.GoogleIdentity) extension
gives you the ability to sign in users using their Google account and then access to the Google APIs
using user authentication tokens.

The simple API allows you to quickly integrate Google identities in your AIR application. Identical
code base can be used across all platforms allowing you to concentrate on your application and not
device specifics.

We provide complete guides to get you up and running with asset selection quickly and easily.
