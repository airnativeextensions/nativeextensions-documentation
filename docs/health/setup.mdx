## Initialise

In order to use the rest of this extensions functionality you must first initialise the extension, specifying the service type you wish to use in your application.

This allows us to provide the same API to various different services.


<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="air" values={[
    {label: 'AIR', value: 'air'},
    {label: 'Unity', value: 'unity'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="air" >

To use the default service just call `initialise()` with no parameters:

```actionscript
// Initialise the default service
Health.instance.initialise();
```

To specify the service type, construct a `HealthService` instance and pass it to the `initialise()` method, eg to use the `HealthService.HEALTH_CONNECT` service:

```actionscript
Health.instance.initialise(
        new HealthService()
                .setServiceType( HealthService.HEALTH_CONNECT )
);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="unity" >

To use the default service just call `Initialise()` with no parameters:

```csharp
// Initialise the default service
Health.Instance.Initialise();
```

To specify the service type, construct a `HealthService` instance and pass it to the `Initialise()` method, eg to use the `HealthService.HEALTH_CONNECT` service:

```csharp
Health.Instance.Initialise(
        new HealthService()
                .SetServiceTypw( HealthService.HEALTH_CONNECT )
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


You can check whether a service is supported via the following:

<Tabs groupId="framework" defaultValue="air" values={[
    {label: 'AIR', value: 'air'},
    {label: 'Unity', value: 'unity'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="air" >

```actionscript
if (Health.instance.isServiceSupported( HealthService.HEALTH_CONNECT ))
{
    // Health Connect is supported
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="unity" >

```csharp
if (Health.Instance.IsServiceSupported( HealthService.HEALTH_CONNECT ))
{
    // Health Connect is supported
}
``` 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Services include: 
- `HealthService.APPLE`: Apple's HealthKit;
- `HealthService.HEALTH_CONNECT`: Android Health Connect;
- `HealthService.FIT`: Google Fitness API;

The default service on iOS is HealthKit, and on Android is Health Connect. 



## Android Health Connect

There is no setup required outside your application to use Health Connect. 



## Google Fitness API

:::warning 
Please note that the Fitness API has been deprecated in favour of Health Connect. You should use Health Connect where possible.
:::

Follow Google's Guide to create an OAuth client ID for your application and add the Fitness API to your Google app console project.

- [Guide](https://developers.google.com/fit/android/get-started)

:::note
