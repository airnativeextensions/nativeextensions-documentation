### Extension IDs

The following should be added to your `extensions` node in your application descriptor to identify all the required ANEs in your application:

```xml
<extensions>
    <extensionID>com.distriqt.OCR</extensionID>
    <extensionID>com.distriqt.Core</extensionID>
    <extensionID>androidx.core</extensionID>
</extensions>
```

#### Dynamic Frameworks

Tesseract is based on a dynamic framework so you must include the framework in your application for signing by AIR.

To do this create a `Frameworks` directory at the top / root level of your application and ensure it is packaged with your AIR application.

It should contain all the `dylib` files in the supplied `Frameworks` directory and the `TesseractOCR.framework` .

Your `Frameworks` directory should at least contain:

```
TesseractOCR.framework
```
