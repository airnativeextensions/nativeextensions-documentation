The following guide is used to manually install the extension, download dependencies and update the application descriptor. We highly recommend installing extensions using `apm`. Using `apm` will automate the installation and automatically handle updates and dependencies along with greatly simplifying the application descriptor generation.

First step is always to add the extension to your development environment.
