> APM, Dialog, ironSource 

What an exciting month for AIR! Harman now has a feasible solution for publishing to AAB on Android and excitingly for us, we have released the first beta of the AIR Package Manager!

I am really excited to get this tool out to developers.

### [AIR Package Manager](https://github.com/airsdk/apm)

We are very excited to release the first beta of APM! It's available now in the repository for Windows and macOS (though it should work anywhere that supports `adl`).

We have made a lot of progress in the past month and are really happy with the progress. The project setup and configuration has been completed to allow you to create a project definition and configuration parameters.

We also have a complete package repository setup and APM will `search`, `view`, `install`, `uninstall` and `update` packages along with our initial take on conflict management.

You can also start creating your own packages, though currently you'll need to reach out to us to be given permission to publish to the repository. We are really excited that the latest release of [`starling`](https://repository.airsdk.dev/packages/starling) is already available in the repository!

#### AIR SDK

The preliminary tools to `list`, `view` and `install` the AIR SDK are available, which includes the ability to see the change log and readme associated with each release.

### [Dialog](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Dialog)

New iOS 14 date / time dialogs are now available in the Dialog extension. This feature brings the Android and iOS implementations closer in functionality with the new iOS style for date selection closely matching the existing Android calendar selection style.

Additionally we added some new features to text input dialogs, including "auto-capitalisation" and "auto-correct" options. 

Check out the extension [here](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Dialog).

- iOS v7.1.7

We also added some API functions to handle the new requirements for using Facebook Audience Network on iOS.
