The following guide is used to manually install the extension, download dependencies and update the application descriptor. We highly recommend installing extensions using `apm`. Using `apm` will automate the installation and automatically handle updates and dependencies along with greatly simplifying the application descriptor generation.

The `com.distriqt.ironsource.Chartboost` ANE includes the Chartboost SDK and the IronSource Chartboost mediation adapter. This is everything you need to get Chartboost mediation working in your application.

To add the ANE download it from the repository and add it to your application:

- [com.distriqt.ironsource.Chartboost](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-IronSource/raw/master/lib/chartboost/com.distriqt.ironsource.Chartboost.ane)

### Google Play Services

This extension requires usage of certain aspects of the Google Play Services client library.
The client library is available as a series of extensions that you add into your applications packaging options.
Each separate extension provides a component(s) from the Play Services client library and are used by different extensions.
These client libraries aren't packaged with this extension as they are used by multiple ANEs and separating them
will avoid conflicts, allowing you to use multiple extensions in the one application.

This extension requires the following Google Play Services:

- [com.distriqt.playservices.Base](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-GooglePlayServices/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.playservices.Base.ane)
- [com.distriqt.playservices.Auth](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-GooglePlayServices/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.playservices.Auth.ane)
- [com.distriqt.playservices.AppSet](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-GooglePlayServices/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.playservices.AppSet.ane)
- [com.distriqt.playservices.AdsIdentifier](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-GooglePlayServices/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.playservices.AdsIdentifier.ane)

You must include the above native extensions in your application along with this extension,
and you need to ensure they are packaged with your application.

You can access the Google Play Services client library extensions here:
[https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-GooglePlayServices](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-GooglePlayServices).

> **Note:** The Google Play Services and Android Support ANEs are only **required** on Android devices.
> There are no issues packaging these extensions with all platforms as there are default implementations available which will allow your code to package without errors however if you are only building an iOS application feel free to remove the Google Play Services and Android Support ANEs from your application.
