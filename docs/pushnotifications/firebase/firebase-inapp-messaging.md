*Firebase In-App Messaging helps you engage your app's active users by sending them targeted, contextual messages that encourage them to use key app features. For example, you could send an in-app message to get users to subscribe, watch a video, complete a level, or buy an item. You can customize messages as cards, banners, modals, or images, and set up triggers so that they appear exactly when they'd benefit your users most.*

*Use Firebase In-App Messaging to encourage exploration and discovery: highlight a sale or coupon in your ecommerce app, give clues or tips in your game, or prompt a like or share in your social media app.*



This is now included in the main [Firebase Cloud Messaging guide](add-the-extension).
