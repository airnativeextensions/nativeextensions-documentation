:::warning DEPRECATED

# Expansion Files

The [Expansion Files](http://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.ExpansionFiles) extension gives access to Android APK Expansion Files from your AIR application.

Google Play currently requires that your application file be no more than a certain limit. For most applications, this is plenty of space for all the application's code and assets. However, some apps need more space for high-fidelity graphics, media files, or other large assets. Previously, if your app exceeded this limit, you had to host and download the additional resources yourself when the user opens the app. Hosting and serving the extra files can be costly, and the user experience is often less than ideal. To make this process easier for you and more pleasant for users, Google Play allows you to attach two large "expansion files" that supplement your APK.

This ANE gives you access to Expansion Files in your Android AIR application.

The simple API allows you to quickly integrate expansion files in your AIR application in
just a few lines of code. We provide complete guides and asdocs to get you up and running
with expansion files quickly and easily.
