To test a location-aware app that uses Location Services, you don't need to move your device from place to place to generate location data. Instead, you can put Location Services into mock mode. In this mode, you can send mock Location objects to Location Services, which then sends them to location clients. In mock mode, Location Services also uses mock Location objects to trigger geofences. 


## Enable Developer Mode

The first thing you will need to do is enable developer mode on your device. If you haven't already done this you can follow our [guide](/docs/tutorials/android-device-debugging).
