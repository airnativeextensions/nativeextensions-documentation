#### Extension IDs

The following should be added to your `extensions` node in your application descriptor to identify all the required ANEs in your application:

```xml
<extensions>
    <extensionID>com.distriqt.Core</extensionID>
    <extensionID>com.distriqt.IronSource</extensionID>

    <extensionID>com.distriqt.ironsource.AppLovin</extensionID>

    <extensionID>com.distriqt.playservices.Base</extensionID>
    <extensionID>com.distriqt.playservices.AdsIdentifier</extensionID>
    <extensionID>com.distriqt.playservices.AppSet</extensionID>

    <extensionID>androidx.core</extensionID>
    <extensionID>com.jetbrains.kotlin</extensionID>
</extensions>
```


#### Android

If there is an `assets` directory alongside the extension in the repository that contains required assets for the installed extensions.
You must add the files in the `assets/android` folder to the root of your Android application package. 


##### Manifest Additions

No additions required


#### iOS

If there is an `assets` directory alongside the extension in the repository that contains required assets for the installed extensions.
You must add the files in the `assets/ios` folder to the root of your iOS application package. 


##### Dynamic Frameworks

This extension uses dynamic frameworks so you must include the frameworks (and any dependent swift libs) in your application for signing by AIR.

To do this create a `Frameworks` directory at the top / root level of your application and ensure it is packaged with your AIR application.

It should contain any of the files in the supplied `assets/ios/Frameworks` directory (including `dylib` and `framework` directories).


##### Info Additions

Add the following to your `InfoAdditions` node:

```xml
<!-- iOS 14 AdNetwork -->
<key>SKAdNetworkItems</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <!-- IronSource -->
        <key>SKAdNetworkIdentifier</key>
        <string>SU67R6K2V3.skadnetwork</string> 
    </dict>
    <dict>
        <!-- AppLovin -->
        <key>SKAdNetworkIdentifier</key>
        <string>ludvb6z3bs.skadnetwork</string>
    </dict>
</array>
```
