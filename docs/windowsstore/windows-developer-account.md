The first step is to sign up for a Windows Developer account. You must have an account 
in order to submit applications to the Windows Store.


## Apply for permission 

In addition to your account you need to get permission for your developer account to submit apps converted with the Desktop Bridge. The Desktop Bridge or Desktop App Converter allows you to convert your desktop AIR application to a UWP application which can be distributed through the Windows Store. 

You apply for permission by using the form at the following url:

https://aka.ms/desktopbridgeforwindowsstore


This process can take some time. We suggest having a working version of your AIR application ready to submit to the store in order to aid this process. It doesn't have to exhibit complete functionality but needs to be at a reasonable stage that they can approve the application quickly. Be prepared to work with the Microsoft representative to get your application approved for using the Desktop Bridge.
