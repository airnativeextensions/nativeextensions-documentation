## Introduction

### What is an app extension.

One key point here is an "App Extension" is an iOS term and is not related to an "AIR Native Extension". 
These concepts are completely different. It is not sensible to create an ANE to implement an App Extension,
even though they are both implementing native code, they constitute different parts of an iOS application.

An iOS "App Extension" is a separate application that is packaged as part of your `ipa` and allows 
you to make functionality available to users while they are using other applications. A more applicable
description is referring to these as "plugins".

An important note here is that an App Extension is created for **one** particular application and 
is tied to it's identifier. It's not distributable like an ANE.


The simplest example of this is a share extension that shows your application as the target of 
a share action in another application. 

More information in the [Apple developer docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/)



### Integrating an App Extension with AIR

Adding an App Extension to your AIR application is entirely possible. However it will require you
to use the native development tools, namely **Xcode** to create the App Extension and then you
can package this as part of your AIR application by placing it in a specific place in your 
package.
