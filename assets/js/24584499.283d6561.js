AIR is in no way \\"deprecated\\" so it\'s important that this information is available.\\n\\nTo this end we have been working with Harman on putting together a modern documentation site for the AIR SDK. We hope this can become the new home of AIR. Check out the site here:\\n\\n[https://airsdk.dev](https://airsdk.dev)\\n\\nThe site is still needs a lot of content. We have been working on porting as much as we can but if you have any interest in contributing check out the site in [github](https://github.com/airsdk/airsdk.dev/). All the documentation is in simple markdown so it should be easy for anyone to contribute.\\n\\n![](images/airpackagemanager.png)\\n\\n### [APM](https://github.com/airsdk/apm)\\n\\nIt is great to see some involvement from the community with APM, but we really would love to have more feedback on the tool. AIR can be used in a myriad of ways so it\'s important to us to get as much feedback as possible while designing this tool.\\n\\nWe have started a series of guides to help you get started using the tool and to highlight the advantages of using it. The first one was published last week and we plan to have another guide each week during October.\\n\\n- [An Introduction to APM](https://medium.com/airnativeextensions/an-introduction-to-apm-29461dc2a20f)\\n\\nOver the last month we have fixed a range of bugs and are getting a final list of features together for a release candidate.\\n\\n![](images/facebook.png)\\n\\n### [Facebook](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.FacebookAPI)\\n\\nThe Facebook extensions have all had SDK updates to:\\n\\n- Android v9.1.1\\n- iOS v9.3.0\\n\\nAdditionally there have been some fixes around gaming services callbacks and some additions for iOS 14 (ad tracking features).\\n\\n![](images/ironsource.png)\\n\\n### [IronSource](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.IronSource)\\n\\nThe ironSource extension has been updated to v7.1.10 of the ironSource SDK and all associated mediation adapters have also been updated to their latest releases.\\n\\n![](images/inappbilling.png)\\n\\n### [InAppBilling](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.InAppBilling)\\n\\nThere have been some functional fixes for the Amazon implementation correcting the consume process and some of the function return values.\\n\\nIf you are using Amazon In-App Purchases we suggest updating to the latest release.\\n\\n![](images/onesignal.png)\\n\\n### [Push Notifications](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.PushNotifications)\\n\\nThe push extension has had the OneSignal SDK support updated to:\\n\\n- Android v4.6.0\\n- iOS v3.7.0\\n\\nThere were also some minor bug fixes around error events that were incorrectly being dispatched.\\n\\n![](images/firebase.png)\\n\\n### [Firebase](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Firebase)\\n\\nThe Firebase extensions have been updated with some fixes around the handling of large data responses particularly in the Firestore and Realtime Database extensions where large JSON responses were being handled inefficiently.

We are super excited about this tool and the way it will change AIR development. I know a lot of the people we talk to emphasise the lack of quick integration being the biggest hurdle with AIR development and we believe this tool is almost ready to resolve that.\\n\\nOther updates include latest AdMob SDK and mediation networks. Flurry SDK has been updated and the new \\"standard events\\" added. CameraUI has had some major changes integrated to support Android 30, and the Scanner extension had some bug fixes released.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![](images/adobeair.png)\\n\\n### AIR SDK Configuration\\n\\nWhile working with apm we have been investigating options to make development using the AIR SDK easier and have come across some concerns around configuration of the SDK.\\n\\nBasically I\'m concerned about the configuration options for a project being placed inside the SDK. I believe this is a really bad practice and that we need to have a more consistent approach for configuration settings. I have raised our concerns on the AIR discussion forum and I think it\'s important as a community that we push a direction for Harman here, before they take the SDK down a bad path.\\n\\nPlease take the time to have a read and let Harman know about where you think the configuration options should be placed.\\n\\nYou can find the discussion here: [https://github.com/airsdk/Adobe-Runtime-Support/discussions/1112](https://github.com/airsdk/Adobe-Runtime-Support/discussions/1112)\\n\\n![](images/airpackagemanager.png)\\n\\n### [AIR Package Manager](https://github.com/airsdk/apm)\\n\\nWe have rolled out several more iterations of the `apm` tool and we have made amazing progress around generation of the application descriptor, most importantly the **automatic generation of the manifest additions for Android**.\\n\\nI seriously cannot emphasise enough how much this will change integrating packages in AIR applications.\\n\\nIt makes adding a new package (extension) to your application as easy as:\\n\\n```\\napm install com.distriqt.CameraUI\\napm generate app-descriptor\\n```\\n\\nAnd your application descriptor will automatically have the manifest additions and extension id\'s inserted, not only for the CameraUI extension but **all the dependencies**!\\n\\nThis is still a work in progress (eg we haven\'t completed iOS merging yet) and we are working hard on getting all our extensions available as packages, but we would really welcome any feedback.\\n\\nFor example, a basic app descriptor after running the above:\\n\\n```\\n<application xmlns=\\"http://ns.adobe.com/air/application/33.1\\">\\n  <id>com.my.app</id>\\n  <versionNumber>1.0.0</versionNumber>\\n  <filename>MyApplication</filename>\\n  <name>My Application</name>\\n  <initialWindow>\\n    <content>[]</content>\\n    <visible>true</visible>\\n    <fullScreen>false</fullScreen>\\n    <autoOrients>false</autoOrients>\\n    <renderMode>direct</renderMode>\\n  </initialWindow>\\n  <android>\\n    <manifestAdditions><![CDATA[<manifest android:installLocation=\\"auto\\" >\\n  <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\\"19\\" android:targetSdkVersion=\\"30\\"/>\\n  <uses-permission android:name=\\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\\"/>\\n  <uses-permission android:name=\\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\\"/>\\n  <application android:appComponentFactory=\\"androidx.core.app.CoreComponentFactory\\" android:hardwareAccelerated=\\"true\\">\\n    <provider android:name=\\"androidx.lifecycle.ProcessLifecycleOwnerInitializer\\" android:authorities=\\"air.com.my.app.lifecycle-process\\" android:exported=\\"false\\" android:multiprocess=\\"true\\"/>\\n    <provider android:name=\\"androidx.startup.InitializationProvider\\" android:authorities=\\"air.com.my.app.androidx-startup\\" android:exported=\\"false\\"/>\\n    <provider android:name=\\"com.distriqt.extension.cameraui.content.FileProvider\\" android:authorities=\\"air.com.my.app.camerauifileprovider\\" android:exported=\\"false\\" android:grantUriPermissions=\\"true\\">\\n      <meta-data android:name=\\"android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS\\" android:resource=\\"@xml/distriqt_cameraui_paths\\"/>\\n    </provider>\\n    <activity android:name=\\"com.distriqt.extension.cameraui.permissions.AuthorisationActivity\\" android:theme=\\"@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar\\"/>\\n  </application>\\n</manifest>\\n]]></manifestAdditions>\\n    <containsVideo>true</containsVideo>\\n  </android>\\n  <extensions>\\n    <extensionID>androidx.core</extensionID>\\n    <extensionID>com.distriqt.CameraUI</extensionID>\\n    <extensionID>com.distriqt.Core</extensionID>\\n  </extensions>\\n</application>\\n```\\n\\nCurrently we have the following air packages available:\\n\\n- All the Google Play Services\\n- All the androidx and android dependencies\\n- Square libs\\n- Camera UI\\n- Flurry\\n- Adverts (including mediators)\\n\\n#### Get Involved\\n\\nThis tool is for the community, so we really want your feedback. It is opensource and publicly available now. If you are at all interested in testing out the client we are looking for any and all feedback!

Additionally the UMP SDK has been updated to version 2.0.0.\\n\\nExcitingly this extension has been released as an airpackage. This means you can use `apm` to install and generate the manifest additions for you.\\n\\n```\\napm install com.distriqt.Adverts\\napm project config set adMobAndroidApplicationId XXXXXXX\\napm project config set adMobIOSApplicationId YYYYYYY\\n```\\n\\n![](images/android.png)\\n\\n### Android 30\\n\\nNow that the AIR SDK supports Android 30 we have been updating all our extensions to support this latest iteration of the Android platform. There are several major changes around opening and querying other installed packages and changes around file access that have affected some of our extensions, such as the CameraUI.\\n\\nIf you run into any issues, please let us know and we will make sure any issues are addressed promptly!\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs always, if you have any native development needs for AIR, Unity, Flutter or Haxe, please feel free to contact us at [airnativeextensions@distriqt.com](mailto:airnativeextensions@distriqt.com)."},{"id":"2021-07","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2021-07","source":"@site/news/2021-07-31-july-news.md","title":"July 2021","description":"APM, Dialog, ironSource","date":"2021-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 31, 2021","tags":[{"label":"newsletter","permalink":"/news/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"air","permalink":"/news/tags/air"},{"label":"apm","permalink":"/news/tags/apm"},{"label":"dialog","permalink":"/news/tags/dialog"},{"label":"ironsource","permalink":"/news/tags/ironsource"}],"readingTime":3.245,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Michael","title":"Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/marchbold","imageURL":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2021-07","title":"July 2021","description":"APM, Dialog, ironSource","image":"images/airpackagemanager.png","author":"Michael","author_title":"Lead Developer","author_url":"https://github.com/marchbold","author_image_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4","tags":["newsletter","air","apm","dialog","ironsource"]},"prevItem":{"title":"August 2021","permalink":"/news/2021-08"},"nextItem":{"title":"June 2021","permalink":"/news/2021-06"}},"content":"> APM, Dialog, ironSource \\n\\nWhat an exciting month for AIR!

Additionally our Adverts and IronSource ANEs have had some functionality updates that may interest some developers.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![](images/facebook.png)\\n\\n### [Facebook](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.FacebookAPI)\\n\\nThe [Facebook extension](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.FacebookAPI) has had a complete rewrite and API redesign over the past few months. The extension was becoming cumbersome to update, mainly due to the continuous changes that Facebook makes to their SDK. These often breaking updates meant that the ANE had a lot of legacy references and deprecated features still included.\\n\\nWith a complete rewrite the extension is now broken into the Facebook SDK components and much simpler to integrate the essential components such as analytics and login. Additionally you only need to include the functionality you require which will reduce the additional size of your application due to the Facebook SDK.\\n\\nCheck out the [updated documentation here](https://docs.airnativeextensions.com/docs/facebookapi/).\\n\\nMigrating user\u2019s have a look at the [migration documentation here](https://docs.airnativeextensions.com/docs/facebookapi/migrating-to-version-8).\\n\\n\\n\\n![](images/flash.png)\\n\\n### [Flash EOL](https://medium.com/airnativeextensions/managing-flash-end-of-life-e7d08b82504c)\\n\\n\\nYou may be worried about the Flash End of Life which will be occurring next year. We wrote a bit of a break down of what\u2019s going to happen earlier this month [here](https://medium.com/airnativeextensions/managing-flash-end-of-life-e7d08b82504c). If you need any help managing or converting existing web applications please feel free to get in [touch with us](mailto:airnativeextensions@distriqt.com). We have helped many clients this year prepare for the removal of the player from browsers.\\n\\n\\n\\n![](images/nativewebview.png)\\n\\n### [Native Web View](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.NativeWebView)\\n\\n\\nA range of fixes and small features have been added to the extension this month, most notably better handling of target=\\"_blank\\" links which you can now control how the webview handles these types of links. They can be opened directly in the system browser, opened in the same webview or blocked so your application can handle them directly.\\n\\nWe have added in some view controls allowing you to scroll/page through the loaded page through code. Additionally we have given you more control over the Windows implementation allowing direct passing of options to the Cef browser.\\n\\nCheck out the Native Web View extension [here](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.NativeWebView).\\n\\n\\n![](images/admob.png)\\n\\n### [Adverts](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Adverts)\\n\\nThe Adverts ANE has been updated with support for [AdMob Open Bidding](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9234488?hl=en#:~:text=AdMob%20initiates%20an%20Open%20Bidding,according%20to%20the%20eCPM%20value.). This feature changes the initialisation process slightly to allow feedback on the available mediation providers supported by your integration and through open bidding.\\n\\n```actionscript\\nAdverts.service.addEventListener( AdvertsEvent.INITIALISED, initialisedHandler );\\n\\nAdverts.service.initialise();\\n\\nfunction initialisedHandler( event:AdvertsEvent ):void \\n{\\n    for each (var adapterStatus:AdapterStatus in e.adapterStatus)\\n    {\\n        trace( \\"adapter: \\" + adapterStatus.name + \\" : \\" + adapterStatus.state + \\" [\\" + adapterStatus.latency + \\"] - \\" + adapterStatus.description );\\n    }\\n}\\n// com.distriqt.Adverts\\n```\\n\\nAdditionally this month we have updated the available AdMob mediators to the latest supported SDKs.\\n\\nCheck out the extension [here](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Adverts).\\n\\n\\n\\n![](images/ironsource.png)\\n\\n### [ironSource](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.IronSource)\\n\\nWe have finally added some of the core functionality from the ironSource SDK that you have been asking for. This includes Banner Ads and the Offerwall. Both features are now available through our ANE along with the latest version of the ironSource SDK!\\n\\nThe ironSource ANE is free and available to all AIR developers!\\n\\n[Get it here](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.IronSource)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nStay safe!"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/welcome","source":"@site/news/2020-09-22-new-documentation.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to the new documentation site for the distriqt // air native extensions!","date":"2020-09-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 22, 2020","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/news/tags/hello"},{"label":"documentation","permalink":"/news/tags/documentation"}],"readingTime":0.13,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Michael","title":"Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/marchbold","imageURL":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","author":"Michael","author_title":"Lead Developer","author_url":"https://github.com/marchbold","author_image_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4","tags":["hello","documentation"]},"prevItem":{"title":"November 2020","permalink":"/news/2020-11"}},"content":"Welcome to the new documentation site for the distriqt // air native extensions!\\n\\nThis site forms the home of all documentation for the distriqt\'s native extensions."}]}')}}]);
