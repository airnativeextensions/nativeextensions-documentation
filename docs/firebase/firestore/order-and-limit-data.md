Cloud Firestore provides powerful query functionality for specifying which documents you want to retrieve from a collection. These queries can also be used with either `query()` or `addSnapshotListener()`, as described in [Get Data](get-data.md).

## Order and limit data

By default, a query retrieves all documents that satisfy the query in ascending order by document ID. You can specify the sort order for your data using `orderBy()`, and you can limit the number of documents retrieved using `limit()`.

For example, you could query for the first 3 cities alphabetically with:

```actionscript
var query:Query = citiesRef.orderBy("name").limit(3);
```

You could also sort in descending order to get the last 3 cities:

```actionscript
var query:Query = citiesRef.orderBy( "name", QueryDirection.DESCENDING ).limit(3);
```

You can also order by multiple fields. For example, if you wanted to order by state, and within each state order by population in descending order:


```actionscript
var query:Query = citiesRef.orderBy("state").orderBy("population", QueryDirection.DESCENDING);
```

You can combine where() filters with orderBy() and limit(). In the following example, the queries define a population threshold, sort by population in ascending order, and return only the first few results that exceed the threshold:

```actionscript
citiesRef.whereGreaterThan("population", 100000).orderBy("population").limit(2);
```

However, if you have a filter with a range comparison (<, <=, >, >=), your first ordering must be on the same field:

**Valid**: Range filter and orderBy on the same field

```actionscript
citiesRef.whereGreaterThan("population", 100000).orderBy("population");
```

**Invalid**: Range filter and first orderBy on different fields

```actionscript
citiesRef.whereGreaterThan("population", 100000).orderBy("country");
```
