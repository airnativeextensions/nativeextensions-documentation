import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'


This latest release brings a number of updates to the extension particularly around android integration. 

We have moved to using gradle dependencies within our extensions which will improve dependency resolution, reduce update times and improve compatibility with other extensions.
This also reduces the amount of work required to manually integrate the extensions, reducing the additions to the manifest (though we still highly recommend using apm for this purpose).

There should be no changes required to your code for this update.

However we do suggest checking out the manifest additions for the latest version of the extension as you should be able to greatly simplify your application descriptor now.



## Android Integration 

### Gradle Dependencies

We have moved to using gradle dependencies within our extensions which will improve dependency resolution, reduce update times and improve compatibility with other extensions.

This also reduces the amount of work required to manually integrate the extensions, reducing the additions to the manifest in your application descriptor.


### Updating code 

There should be no changes required to your code for this update.


### Updating the manifest 

You can simplify the manifest now as well as the gradle implementation will add a significant amount of the required manifest entries for you. 
If you use the `apm` tool to generate your application descriptor 

We highly recommend using the [apm](https://airnativeextensions.com/docs/using-apm) tool to manage the integration of the extensions in your application and to generate your application descriptor:

```bash
apm generate app-descriptor
```

You will see the manifest entries are significantly reduced and simply running the commands above will update the manifest for you.

However, you can still integrate the manifest additions manually if you prefer. With this update we recommend starting fresh as there have been a lot of entries to be removed.

If you manually update the manifest then, we recommend starting fresh as there have been a lot of entries to be removed.
The minimum manifest additions now looks like the following:

```xml
<manifest android:installLocation="auto">
	<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="21" android:targetSdkVersion="34"/>
	
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
	
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED" />

	<application>
		
		<!-- AUTO START and ALARM MANAGER -->
		<receiver android:enabled="true"
			android:name="com.distriqt.extension.application.receivers.ApplicationStartupReceiver"
			android:permission="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"
			android:exported="false">
			<intent-filter>
				<action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" />
				<category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
			</intent-filter>
		</receiver>

		<!-- ALARM MANAGER -->
		<receiver android:name="com.distriqt.extension.application.alarms.AlarmReceiver" android:enabled="true" android:exported="false" />
		<activity android:name="com.distriqt.extension.application.alarms.AlarmActivity" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar" android:exported="false" />

		<!-- SETTINGS -->

		<activity android:name="com.distriqt.core.auth.AuthorisationActivity" android:exported="false" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"/>

	</application>

</manifest>
