The simplest way to install and manage your AIR native extensions and libraries is to use the AIR Package Manager (`apm`). We highly recommend using `apm`, as it will handle downloading all required dependencies and manage your application descriptor (Android manifest additions, iOS info additions etc).

However you can choose to install it manually, as you would have done in the past. 


## Setup

You should first gather some information for your application. 

The *Bundle Seed Id* or *App ID Prefix* is an identifier for your iOS application. If you look at your application identifier in your [developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/) you will see the *App ID Prefix* listed. It is of the form `XYZ1234WCJ` (10 alpha-numeric characters).



## Install


<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<InstallAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<InstallManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>


## Application Descriptor

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<AppDescriptorAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<AppDescriptorManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>



## Document Storage 

If you plan to use document storage then you will need to create an iCloud container in your application identifier through the [developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/).

Find your application identifier then select the iCloud option and add your container. Take a note of the "cloud identifier" for the container as you will need this when configuring your application.

:::note 
Document storage is not supported on Apple tvOS. If you are supporting this platform you should not include the `com.apple.developer.ubiquity-container-identifiers` key in your entitlements. 

If you are supporting both platforms then we suggest you create a separate project / application descriptor for each and only add the following to your iOS project.
:::

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >

If you plan on using document storage in an iCloud container then you need to add some additional configuration. Firstly add a custom iOS configuration file by running:

```
apm generate config ios
```

Edit the `config/ios/Entitlements.xml` file that was generated to resemble the following, adding the `com.apple.developer.ubiquity-container-identifiers` node:

```xml
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>

		<!-- ICLOUD ENTITLEMENTS -->
    	<key>com.apple.developer.ubiquity-container-identifiers</key>
		<array>
			<string>${iCloudContainerId}</string>
		</array>

    </dict>
</plist>
```

> The `iCloudContainerId` value will get inserted from your apm project configuration.

Once you have added this configuration run the steps above to update / generate your [application descriptor](#application-descriptor).


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >

To enable support for document storage you will need to add a list of the container ids that you have created and plan to use in your application into the `Entitlements` section in your application descriptor.

These container identifiers must match exactly the ones you created in the developer member center.

For example, the distriqt test application uses a container with an identifier: `iCloud.com.distriqt.test.testcontainer`

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.ubiquity-container-identifiers</key>
<array>
	<string>iCloud.com.distriqt.test.testcontainer</string>
</array>
```

  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>




## Checking for Support

You can use the `isSupported` flag to determine if this extension is supported on the current platform and device.

This allows you to react to whether the functionality is available on the device and provide an alternative solution if not.

```actionscript 
if (CloudStorage.isSupported)
{
	// Functionality here
}
```
