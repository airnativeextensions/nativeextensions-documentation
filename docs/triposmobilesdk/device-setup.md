## Pairing Bluetooth Devices

You will need to pair your eftpos device with your mobile.  

### Tetra Menu Access on the IngenicoUpp Devices

Accessing the Tetra menu access while the IngenicoUpp device is offline, in idle, or connected to the SDK:
- `0 0 0 0` - System information
- `0 0 0 1` - Communication admin menu
- `2 6 3 4` - Tetra system menu

Use the communication menu to select bluetooth communication options and place the device in pairing mode. 

Then go to your device and access the bluetooth menu and search for a new device. Select the terminal and then ensure the numbers match on both devices.
