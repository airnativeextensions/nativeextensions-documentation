Updating your application descriptor will insert the required `extensionID`'s and generate the manifest and info additions for your application. 

You update your application descriptor by running:

```
apm generate app-descriptor src/MyApp-app.xml
```

Change the path (`src/MyApp-app.xml`) to point to your application descriptor.

:::caution
This will modify your application descriptor replacing the manifest additions and info additions with the ones generated from `apm`. 

You should backup your application descriptor before running this command to ensure you don't lose any information.

If you need to insert custom data into these sections see the guides for [Android](https://github.com/airsdk/apm/wiki/Usage-Generate#android) and [iOS](https://github.com/airsdk/apm/wiki/Usage-Generate#ios)

### Permissions

To add the permissions you need to use you will need to add them to your manifest. Permissions are represented with a tag like the following:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

A complete list of the possible permissions is found [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission).

To add these additions you need to add some additional configuration to apm. Firstly add a custom Android configuration file by running:

```
apm generate config android
```

Edit the `config/android/AndroidManifest.xml` file that was generated to resemble the following, adding the required permissions, eg:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">

	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />

</manifest>
```

You can add any other additions you require in your application here and these will be merged by `apm` when you generate your application descriptor (see above).
