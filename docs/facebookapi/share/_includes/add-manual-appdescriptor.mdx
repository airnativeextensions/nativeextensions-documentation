### Extension IDs

The following should be added to your `extensions` node in your application descriptor to identify all the required ANEs in your application:

```xml
<extensions>
	<extensionID>com.distriqt.facebook.Core</extensionID>
	<extensionID>com.distriqt.facebook.Share</extensionID>

	<extensionID>com.distriqt.Core</extensionID>
	<extensionID>com.distriqt.Bolts</extensionID>

	<extensionID>androidx.appcompat</extensionID>
	<extensionID>androidx.browser</extensionID>
	<extensionID>androidx.cardview</extensionID>
	<extensionID>androidx.core</extensionID>
	<extensionID>androidx.emoji2</extensionID>
	<extensionID>androidx.vectordrawable</extensionID>
	<extensionID>com.android.installreferrer</extensionID>
	<extensionID>com.jetbrains.kotlin</extensionID>
</extensions>
```



### Android

#### Manifest Additions

The Facebook Share extension requires some manifest additions beyond the ones you have added for the Facebook Core extension.

You should add the following to your manifest additions, you will need to replace `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` with your Facebook App ID, the same way you did when adding the Core extension.

These additions should go inside the `application` node in your manifest additions.

```xml
<!-- Share -->
<provider android:authorities="com.facebook.app.FacebookContentProviderFACEBOOK_APP_ID"
	android:name="com.facebook.FacebookContentProvider"
	android:exported="true"/>
```


### iOS 

#### Dynamic Frameworks

Facebook is based on a dynamic framework so you must include the framework and dependent swift libs in your application for signing by AIR.

To do this create a `Frameworks` directory at the top / root level of your application and ensure it is packaged with your AIR application.

If should contain any of the files in the supplied `Frameworks` directory (including `dylib` and `framework` directories) and any of the Facebook SDK components that you are using in your application.

The Core extension requires several frameworks so your `Frameworks` directory should contain:

```
FBAEMKit.framework
FBSDKCoreKit_Basics.framework
FBSDKCoreKit.framework
FBSDKShareKit.framework
```


#### Info Additions

The Facebook Share extension doesn't require any info additions beyond the ones you have added for the Facebook Core extension.

However you should ensure that you added the `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` and `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription` usage description strings as these will be used when sharing certain content.
