The inset from the top of the display\\n- `safeArea.left` - The inset from the left of the display\\n- `safeArea.right` - The inset from the right of the display\\n- `safeArea.bottom` - The inset from the bottom of the display\\n\\nYou can then use these values to position your interactive elements within the safe area of the display.\\n\\n\\n## Applying Safe Area\\n\\nTo apply the safe area insets to your application layout you can use the values from the `Insets` object to adjust the position of your interactive elements.\\n\\n> \\n> Applying the safe area will depend on your application layout and framework but generally you will want to add padding to the edges of your layout equal to the safe area insets.\\n>  \\n\\nFor example to position a button in the top left of the safe area you could do the following:\\n\\n```actionscript\\nvar safeArea:Insets = Display.instance.windowInsets.getSafeArea();\\nmyButton.x = safeArea.left + desiredPadding;\\nmyButton.y = safeArea.top + desiredPadding;\\n```\\n\\n### Using a Container\\n\\nI highly recommend adding a container for your UI elements and applying the safe area insets to that container so that all child elements are positioned correctly. \\n\\nFor example if you are using Feathers UI in a Starling application you could do the following:\\n\\n```actionscript\\n// Create a container for UI elements\\nvar uiContainer:LayoutGroup = new LayoutGroup();\\nuiContainer.width = Starling.current.stage.stageWidth;\\nuiContainer.height = Starling.current.stage.stageHeight;\\naddChild( uiContainer );\\n\\n\\n// Apply the safe area insets\\nvar safeArea:Insets = Display.instance.windowInsets.getSafeArea();\\nvar safeAreaScaled:Insets = safeArea.scale( 1 / Starling.contentScaleFactor );\\n\\nvar layout:VerticalLayout = new VerticalLayout();\\nlayout.paddingTop = safeAreaScaled.top;\\nlayout.paddingLeft = safeAreaScaled.left;\\nlayout.paddingRight = safeAreaScaled.right;\\nlayout.paddingBottom = safeAreaScaled.bottom;\\n\\nuiContainer.layout = layout;\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n## Status and Navigation Bars\\n\\nYou will likely want to draw behind the system status and navigation bars while still allowing user interaction with them. \\n\\n![](images/display/statusbar-example.png)\\n\\nThe default mode for these with AIR is a solid background which doesn\'t really fit with modern Android UI design.\\n\\n![](images/display/statusbar-air-default.png)\\n\\n\\nThe suggested approach is to set the status and navigation bars to be transparent so that your application can be seen behind them.\\nIf you want a solid colour you can simply add a rectangle behind them in your application design, or alternatively you can \\nrender your content behind them for a more immersive experience.\\n\\nYou can use the Display extension to set the status bar style. This call sets the status bar to have light icons and a transparent background with recent versions of Android:\\n\\n```actionscript\\nDisplay.instance.setStatusBarStyle( StatusBarStyle.LIGHT );\\n```\\n\\n| Light Status Bar | Dark Status Bar | \\n| --- | --- | \\n| ![](images/display/statusbar-light.png) | ![](images/display/statusbar-dark.png) |\\n\\n\\nSimlarly you can set the navigation bar style:\\n\\n```actionscript\\nDisplay.instance.setNavigationBarStyle( NavigationBarStyle.LIGHT );\\n```\\n\\n| Light Navigation Bar | Dark Navigation Bar | \\n| --- | --- | \\n| ![](images/display/navbar-light.png) | ![](images/display/navbar-dark.png) |\\n\\n\\n:::note \\nThe navigation bar style is only relevant when the user has selected to use button navigation rather than gesture navigation on their device.\\nGesture navigation displays a small bar at the bottom of the screen which reflects the system dark mode theme setting.\\n:::\\n\\n## Best Results \\n\\nTo get the best results when managing edge-to-edge displays, consider the following tips:\\n\\n- Set your application not to use full screen mode in the application descriptor. This allows the extension to manage the layout of your application correctly.\\n    ```xml\\n    <fullScreen>false</fullScreen>\\n    ```\\n\\n- Set the display mode to match your needs, generally we recommend `DisplayMode.NORMAL` to allow your application to draw behind the system bars while still allowing user interaction with them.\\n\\n    ```actionscript\\n    Display.instance.setDisplayMode( DisplayMode.NORMAL );\\n    ```\\n\\n- Set the status bar style to match your application design. For example, if your application has a dark background, you may want to set the status bar style to light:\\n\\n    ```actionscript\\n    Display.instance.setStatusBarStyle( StatusBarStyle.LIGHT );\\n    ```\\n\\n- Create a container for your UI and apply the safe area insets to your layout to ensure that interactive elements are not obscured by system UI elements.\\n\\n- If you plan to support dark mode you can use the `userInterfaceStyle` property of the `Display` instance to determine the current system theme and adjust your application design accordingly.\\n\\n    ```actionscript\\n    if (Display.instance.userInterfaceStyle == UserInterfaceStyle.DARK)\\n    {\\n        // Apply dark mode design\\n    }\\n    else\\n    {\\n        // Apply light mode design\\n    }\\n    ```"},{"id":"2025-11","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2025-11","source":"@site/news/2025-11-30-november-news.md","title":"November 2025","description":"Extension Updates","date":"2025-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"newsletter","permalink":"/news/tags/newsletter"},{"inline":true,"label":"agerange","permalink":"/news/tags/agerange"},{"inline":true,"label":"webp","permalink":"/news/tags/webp"}],"readingTime":3.78,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Michael","title":"Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/marchbold","imageURL":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4","key":"marchbold","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2025-11","title":"November 2025","description":"Extension Updates","image":"images/adobeair.png","authors":["marchbold"],"tags":["newsletter","agerange","webp"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Edge-to-Edge Displays","permalink":"/news/2025/12/16/edge-to-edge-displays"},"nextItem":{"title":"October 2025","permalink":"/news/2025-10"}},"content":"> November Release Roundup\\n\\nWelcome to this month\u2019s extension update!

Please note that the extension and the underlying SDKs are all still flagged as beta.\\n:::\\n\\nAge-gating in applications has always required a careful balance between safety, privacy, and platform compliance. This extension introduces unified support for modern age-verification flows on both iOS and Android, giving developers a consistent and privacy-respecting way to deliver age-appropriate content without handling sensitive personal data.\\n\\nOn iOS 26, Apple\u2019s new DeclaredAgeRange API enables apps to request an age range (for example 13+, 16+, or 18+) without ever asking for or storing a user\u2019s birthdate. This allows developers to responsibly tailor features and content while aligning with Apple\u2019s updated privacy and child-safety requirements.\\n\\nOn Android, the extension integrates Google Play\u2019s new Play Age Signals API. This API allows apps to retrieve age-related signals, notify Google Play when major app changes require renewed parental approval, and receive alerts if prior approvals are revoked. These capabilities help developers meet compliance obligations in jurisdictions with age-verification laws\u2014such as Texas, Utah, and Louisiana\u2014while keeping full responsibility for ensuring adherence to all applicable regulations and Google Play policies.\\n\\nTogether, these platform-specific integrations allow developers to implement age-appropriate experiences across both ecosystems using one consistent extension, all while maintaining strong privacy protections and avoiding unnecessary collection of sensitive user data.\\n\\nAvailable now [here](https://github.com/airnativeextensions/ANE-AgeRange)  or via apm:\\n\\n```bash\\napm install com.distriqt.AgeRange\\n```\\n\\n\\n--- \\n\\n### Display\\n\\nThe Display extension is a new extension I\'m working on to address the aging display modes and keyboard integration in the [Application extension](https://github.com/airsdk/Adobe-Runtime-Support/discussions/3947). \\n\\nThis new extension aims to use the more modern approach around managing display modes and monitoring the keyboard.

The application is contained within the window insets.\\n\\n![](images/android35-edge-to-edge-4.png)\\n\\nAfter updating your target sdk to 35 you will find that your application is now expected to handle the window insets and is rendered edge-to-edge. However, many elements are now hidden by the status bar, 3-button navigation bar, or display cutout due to the Android 15 edge-to-edge enforcements. \\n\\n![](images/android35-edge-to-edge-6.png)\\n\\nYou will need to update your application to correctly handle rendering within the window insets and render within these bounds so UI elements are not hidden.\\n\\n![](images/android35-edge-to-edge-2.png)\\n\\n\\n### Handling window insets\\n\\nTo get the safe area to render you can use the [Application](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Application) extension to retrieve the display cutout information:\\n\\n```actionscript\\nvar displayCutout:DisplayCutout = Application.service.display.getDisplayCutout();\\n```\\n\\nThis object contains 4 properties: `safeInsetBottom`, `safeInsetTop`, `safeInsetLeft`, `safeInsetRight`, each indicating the number of pixels from the edge of the screen that system bars or cutouts may affect.\\n\\nThere is also an `boundingRects` property containing detailed areas for any cutouts that may affect rendering.\\n\\n\\nYou can use this to apply bounds to your root content \\"safe area\\", eg using a starling `_safeArea` object for rendering UI elements you can use something like the following :\\n\\n```actionscript\\nif (Application.isSupported)\\n{\\n    var cutout:DisplayCutout = Application.service.display.getDisplayCutout();\\n    var topInset:Number = cutout.safeInsetTop / _scale;\\n    var bottomInset:Number = cutout.safeInsetBottom / _scale;\\n    var leftInset:Number = cutout.safeInsetLeft / _scale;\\n    var rightInset:Number = cutout.safeInsetRight / _scale;\\n\\n    _safeArea.setTo(leftInset, topInset,\\n        _stageWidth - leftInset - rightInset,\\n        _stageHeight - topInset - bottomInset);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n:::note\\nIf you use immersive mode or change display modes at any time in your application you should ensure to reapply these corrections afterwards. \\n:::\\n\\n\\n### Cutouts \\n\\nIf your app targets SDK 35 and is running on an Android 15 device, `LayoutMode.CUTOUT_ALWAYS` is the default behavior. This means that if you were previously relying on setting the LayoutMode eg via calling \\n\\n```actionscript\\nApplication.service.display.setDisplayMode( \\n    DisplayMode.FULLSCREEN, \\n    LayoutMode.CUTOUT_NEVER );\\n```\\n\\nthis will be interpretted as \\"always\\" and your content will be drawn into cutout regions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Opt-out\\n\\nAs a temporary workaround you can opt-out of this edge-to-edge enforcement in v35.\\n\\n:::caution\\nThis option to opt-out will be removed once you update to target v36, so this workaround should only be treated as temporary.\\n:::\\n\\nFirstly, create a custom resources folder in your application and package it according to the guide [here](https://airsdk.dev/docs/tutorials/platform/android/custom-resources).\\n\\nUnder your resources folder create a `values-v35` folder and add a file `styles.xml` into this folder with the following content:\\n\\n```xml title=\\"styles.xml\\"\\n<?xml version=\\"1.0\\" encoding=\\"utf-8\\"?>\\n<resources>\\n\\n    <style name=\\"Theme.NoShadow\\" parent=\\"android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar\\">\\n        <item name=\\"android:windowContentOverlay\\">@null</item>\\n        <item name=\\"android:windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement\\">true</item>\\n    </style>\\n\\n</resources>\\n```\\n\\nThe `android:windowOptOutEdgeToEdgeEnforcement` option is the critical one that will disable this edge-to-edge enforcement for Android 35."},{"id":"2025-07","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2025-07","source":"@site/news/2025-07-30-july-updates.md","title":"July 2025","description":"Extension Updates","date":"2025-07-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"newsletter","permalink":"/news/tags/newsletter"},{"inline":true,"label":"inappbilling","permalink":"/news/tags/inappbilling"},{"inline":true,"label":"adverts","permalink":"/news/tags/adverts"},{"inline":true,"label":"googleidentity","permalink":"/news/tags/googleidentity"}],"readingTime":3.36,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Michael","title":"Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/marchbold","imageURL":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4","key":"marchbold","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2025-07","title":"July 2025","description":"Extension Updates","image":"images/adobeair.png","authors":["marchbold"],"tags":["newsletter","inappbilling","adverts","googleidentity"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Android 15 UI Changes","permalink":"/news/2025/08/08/android-35-ui-changes"},"nextItem":{"title":"June 2025","permalink":"/news/2025-06"}},"content":"> Play Billing v7 (Android 35), Adverts\\n\\nWe\'ve had a big month of updates!

Choose your payment method and complete the payment.\\n6. You\'ll receive a confirmation email with all the details of your new subscription.\\n\\n:::note\\nExisting subscriptions that you migrate together will be grouped into a single subscription. You should note that this means you\'ll be billed for these together and also that if you look to cancel in the future you will need to cancel all extensions associated with the subscription. \\n\\nYou may wish to migrate extensions individually based on your needs.\\n:::\\n\\nWe understand that change can be challenging, but we believe this upgrade will ultimately enhance your experience with our extensions.

The minimum manifest additions now look something like the following:\\n\\n```xml\\n<manifest android:installLocation=\\"auto\\" >\\n  <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\\"21\\" android:targetSdkVersion=\\"34\\"/>\\n  <uses-permission android:name=\\"android.permission.INTERNET\\"/>\\n  <application>\\n    <meta-data android:name=\\"android.max_aspect\\" android:value=\\"2.5\\"/>\\n    <meta-data android:name=\\"android.notch_support\\" android:value=\\"true\\"/>\\n\\n    <activity android:name=\\"com.distriqt.core.auth.AuthorisationActivity\\" android:exported=\\"false\\" android:theme=\\"@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar\\"/>\\n  </application>\\n</manifest>\\n```\\n\\nYou will need to go through each extension you are using and add in any specific permissions, activities, receivers and services for those extensions. \\n\\nWe have added migration guides for most of the extensions highlighting the changes so you can check these for help in updating, for example:\\n\\n- [Adverts](https://docs.airnativeextensions.com/docs/adverts/migrating-to-version-16.0)\\n- [InAppBilling](https://docs.airnativeextensions.com/docs/inappbilling/migration-v16.0)\\n- [Firebase](https://docs.airnativeextensions.com/docs/firebase/migrating-to-v10.0)\\n- [PushNotifications](https://docs.airnativeextensions.com/docs/pushnotifications/migrating-to-v16.0)\\n\\n\\n\\n--- \\n\\n![](images/airnativeextension-packages.png)\\n\\n### New Payment System\\n\\nNext month we are migrating to a new payment provider. Unfortunately our existing provider will no longer support certain tax durisdictions which has meant we either had to stop providing our extensions or we move to a new provider. Due to the small timeline given to us we have been scrambling to change over all our systems to support a new provider and ensure there is little disruption to your service. \\n\\nOver the coming weeks we will be sending out information on how to handle your subscription renewals to ensure you continue to have access to the extensions. \\n\\nIf you notice any issues or have any concerns, please reach out to us [airnativeextensions@distriqt.com](mailto:airnativeextensions@distriqt.com)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/custom-development.png)\\n\\n### Custom Development Work\\n\\n**Exciting News \u2013 We\u2019re Expanding Our Development Capacity!**\\n\\nThis year, we\u2019re opening up our schedule to take on more development work!

It provides real user data, error insights, diagnostics, and integrations to improve app quality and user experience.*\\n>\\n\\nThe extension provides error monitoring to monitor app health and streamline your debugging workflow, and automatically converts AIR Errors to native error reports. We developed this extension when reports of the other extension supporting BugSnag was having issues, so we focussed on creating an extension that delivers useful error reports for AIR mobile developers.\\n\\n```actionscript\\ntry\\n{\\n    throw new Error( \\"An error occurred\\", 1023 )\\n}\\ncatch (e:Error)\\n{\\n    BugSnag.instance.notifyError( e );\\n}\\n```\\n\\nYou can access the new extension [here](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.bugsnag/).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### AIR Splash Screen Example\\n\\nWith some of the AIR updates from Harman we can now supply native Android splash screens via resoruces. \\n\\nThis process is fairly simple:\\n\\n- Add a custom resources directory (eg `res`) to your app and set `<resdir>res</resdir>` in your manifest (see [custom resources](https://airsdk.dev/docs/tutorials/platform/android/custom-resources) for more info).\\n- Set your target sdk to at least 31 in the manifest additions in your app descriptor:\\n\\n```xml\\n<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\\"24\\" android:targetSdkVersion=\\"34\\" />\\n```\\n\\n- Add a values-v31 directory and create a styles.xml in that folder with the following content:\\n\\n```xml\\n<?xml version=\\"1.0\\" encoding=\\"utf-8\\"?>\\n<resources>\\n\\n\\t<style name=\\"Theme.NoShadow\\" parent=\\"Theme.App.Splash\\">\\n\\t</style>\\n\\n\\t<style name=\\"Theme.App.Splash\\" parent=\\"android:style/Theme.NoTitleBar\\">\\n\\t\\t\x3c!-- Set your splash properties here --\x3e\\n\\t\\t<item name=\\"android:windowSplashScreenBackground\\">#ff0000</item>\\n\\t\\t<item name=\\"android:windowSplashScreenAnimatedIcon\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t@drawable/splash_screen_animateable_icon\\n\\t\\t</item>\\n\\t\\t<item name=\\"android:windowSplashScreenAnimationDuration\\">600</item>\\n\\t\\t<item name=\\"android:windowSplashScreenIconBackgroundColor\\">#004d28</item>\\n\\t</style>\\n\\n</resources>\\n```\\n\\n- Here I have used an animatable icon (drawable/splash_screen_animateable_icon.xml) which could be anything but I\'ve got this in it just showing the app logo:\\n\\n```xml\\n<animation-list xmlns:android=\\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\\"\\n    android:oneshot=\\"true\\">\\n    <item android:drawable=\\"@mipmap/icon\\" android:duration=\\"600\\" />\\n</animation-list>\\n```\\n\\nYou can find a project demonstrating a custom splash screen in this repository: https://github.com/marchbold/air-splashscreen-example\\n\\n--- \\n\\n\\n![](images/firebase.png)\\n\\n### [Firebase](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Firebase)\\n\\nFirebase has been updated to the latest release. \\n\\nFirebase is interconnected with a lot of Google services so these updates are a significant amount of work for us.

This is normally done by AIR automatically however with the latest AIR release you can now specify an option on an extension in your application to *delay load* the extension functionality. \\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\nThe loading process consists of finding and loading the bytes from the `library.swf` within the extension, then parsing this library into the AS3 engine so that it\'s available when applications use symbols from within the extension. As the definitions for classes and interfaces contained within the extension aren\'t accessible before the extension is loaded you must ensure you have clear separation in your code structure of where you use the extensions functionality.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo we suggest separating the loading of the extensions and ensuring all of your usage of extensions are separated into classes that aren\'t accessed until after the load process is completed. \\n\\n\\n\\n## Enabling Delay Load\\n\\n\\nFirstly you will need to enable delayed loading of your extensions by editing your application descriptor and changing the extensions you wish to delay load to have the `delayLoad` attribute as below:\\n\\n```xml\\n<extensionID delayLoad=\\"true\\">com.distriqt.Core</extensionID>\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n:::caution \\nWith this attribute enabled the extension symbols will not be loaded automatically at startup. \\n\\nIf you attempt to use a definition (a class or an interface) from within an extension before it is loaded then you will encounter a runtime error. \\n:::\\n\\n### Issues\\n\\nIt\'s important to understand the side effects of this delay load operation as you may have to restructure your code to support it. \\n\\nThe first issue is that creating instances or calling static methods of a symbol defined in an extension will result in a runtime error. For example, a call to: \\n\\n```actionscript\\nCore.init();\\n```\\n\\nwould result in an error:\\n\\n```\\nError #1065: Variable com.distriqt.extension.core::Core is not defined.\\n```\\n\\n\\nThe second issue can be more critical as it requires careful planning of your function definitions, particularly important for event handlers. \\n\\nIf a function is defined with a parameter of a class from the extension, eg \\n\\n\\n```actionscript\\n// Firstly load the extension ...\\n\\ntestFunction( ... );\\n\\nfunction testFunction( param:SomeExtensionClass ):void\\n{\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\nit will result in a verify error:\\n\\n```\\nVerifyError: Error #1014: Class extension::SomeExtensionClass could not be found.\\n``` \\n\\n**Even though you have loaded the extension before using the function, the definition of the function causes an error.**\\n\\nThis demonstrates why it is important to separate the extensions functionality into a separate class that isn\'t accessed until the extension is loaded. \\n\\ni.e. if this function was moved into another class, say `TestClass`, then you could access this same functionality via the following pseudo code:\\n\\n```actionscript\\n// Firstly load the extension ...\\n\\n// Then use the extension functionality in the TestClass:\\nvar test:TestClass = new TestClass();\\ntest.testFunction( ... );\\n```\\n\\nThis way the definition of the function isn\'t used until after the extension is loaded and you won\'t encounter an error. \\n\\n\\n## Loading an Extension\\n\\nTo load the extension you use methods of the `flash.external.ExtensionContext` class. Loading an extension is a synchronous process and requires the `extensionID` as a parameter:\\n\\n```actionscript\\nExtensionContext.loadExtension( extensionID, null );\\n```\\n\\nImmediately after this call the symbols from the extension will be available so a call to `Core.init();` will now succeed.\\n\\nThis process may still take some time so it is suggested to not just have a series of `loadExtension` calls following one another but instead ensure time passes between each call as part of a load process. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Extension Information\\n\\nThere are a range of helper functionality available in the `ExtensionContext` class to help with loading extensions.\\n\\n\\n### Known Extensions\\n\\nYou can list the extensions that are contained in the application descriptor via the `ExtensionContext.knownExtensions` property. This property is an array of `extensionID` string values each representing an extension identifier listed in the `extensions` node of your application descriptor.\\n\\n```actionscript\\nfor each (var extensionID:String in ExtensionContext.knownExtensions)\\n{\\n    trace( extensionID );\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n### Extension Info\\n\\nThe `ExtensionInfo` class contains information about the state of a particular extension. \\n\\nYou obtain the current information for an extension by calling `getExtensionInfo()`:\\n\\n```actionscript\\nvar info:ExtensionInfo = ExtensionContext.getExtensionInfo( extensionID );\\n```\\n\\nThis class contains a range of information (most of it is extracted from the extension itself) including:\\n- `extensionID`: The identifier for this extension;\\n- `name`: The extension name, as provided in the extension\'s XML descriptor file;\\n- `description`:  The extension description, as provided in the extension\'s XML descriptor file;\\n- `versionNumber`:  The extension version number, as provided in the extension\'s XML descriptor file;\\n\\nAdditionally it contains two properties useful for handling loading of extensions:\\n\\n- `isDynamic`: A Boolean value indicating whether the extension is a \'dynamically loaded\' extension or not, ie. whether the `delayLoad` attribute has been set to `true`;\\n- `isLoaded`: A Boolean value indicating whether the extension has been loaded or not;"},{"id":"2023-11","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2023-11","source":"@site/news/2023-11-30-november-news.md","title":"November 2023","description":"Extension Updates","date":"2023-11-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"newsletter","permalink":"/news/tags/newsletter"},{"inline":true,"label":"airsdk","permalink":"/news/tags/airsdk"},{"inline":true,"label":"application-rater","permalink":"/news/tags/application-rater"},{"inline":true,"label":"adverts","permalink":"/news/tags/adverts"},{"inline":true,"label":"google-play-billing","permalink":"/news/tags/google-play-billing"}],"readingTime":3.59,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Michael","title":"Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/marchbold","imageURL":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4","key":"marchbold","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2023-11","title":"November 2023","description":"Extension Updates","image":"images/contacts.png","authors":["marchbold"],"tags":["newsletter","airsdk","application-rater","adverts","google-play-billing"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Delay Loading Extensions","permalink":"/news/2023/12/15/delay-load-extensions"},"nextItem":{"title":"Game Center requirements","permalink":"/news/2023/08/25/game-center-entitlement"}},"content":"> ANE updates, AIR SDK Manager \\n\\nThis year has been remarkably busy and unfortunately news updates were pushed down the list, but as the year comes to a close I\'d like to update on what we see as the major native extension news over the past months.\\n\\nMajor changes across all our extensions include:\\n- iOS/macOS Xcode 14 update that required removal of bitcode support and increasing the minimum sdk to 12;\\n- Android permissions overhaul for new Android 33+ requirements;\\n- Android compatibility when running AIR in a background thread; \\n- Apple Silicon support for our macOS extensions;\\n\\nWe have several major projects in the works including:\\n- Scanner rewrite away from the deprecated library currently in use;\\n- Migration to gradle dependencies in all our dependency extensions;\\n- apm integration with IDEs;\\n\\nSome of the key recent changes are listed below.\\n\\nLooking forward to another year of amazing AIR development!\\n\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/contacts.png)\\n\\n### [Contacts](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Contacts)\\n\\nA complete rewrite of the iOS implementation of the Contacts extension brings the latest functionality from iOS using the newer Contacts framework. \\n\\nThis update should vastly improve performance of contact retrieval and ensures support on the latest versions of iOS.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/gameservices.png)\\n\\n### [Game Services](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.GameServices)\\n\\nWe added support to the Game Services extension for Huawei Game Service v6.10.

This will give you access to the tools to request access to the advertising identifier and install the required dependencies for it\'s usage.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/application-rater.png)\\n\\n### [Application Rater](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.ApplicationRater)\\n\\nThe Application Rater extension has been updated to support the Samsung Galaxy store. \\n\\nThis means that it will now detect if your application was installed through the Galaxy store and correctly redirect to the rating page in the Galaxy store from the rating dialog.\\n\\nYou can find more information about handling ratings from the different stores in the documentation on [Handling Stores](/docs/applicationrater/handling-stores)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/playbilling.png)\\n\\n### [InAppBilling](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.InAppBilling)\\n\\nWith the latest update to v5 of the play billing library, several developers have noted that certain devices don\'t return a product list from the `getProducts()` call and instead get an error dispatched.\\n\\nThe latest Play Billing library requires an updated version of the Play Store application to be installed on the device so you may want to check for the availability of this before attempting to retrieve the product list. \\n\\nWe have added some helpers to check for the availability of the billing service on the current device and included a response that indicates if the store application needs updating:\\n\\n```actionscript\\nInAppBilling.service.checkAvailability(\\n        function ( availability:String ):void\\n        {\\n            if (availability == InAppBillingAvailability.STORE_UPGRADE_REQUIRED) \\n            {\\n                // An update for the play store application is required\\n            }\\n        }\\n);\\n```\\n\\nFor more information on the availabilty see the [documentation](/docs/inappbilling/billing-service#availability).\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/permissions.png)\\n\\n### [Permissions](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.Permissions)\\n\\nThe permissions extension has had some updates to improve the `openDirectory()` functionality including returning an event on result (`PermissionsEvent.OPEN_DOCUMENT`) which contains the path the user selected.\\n\\nYou can read more about this change [here](/docs/permissions/file-folder-access).\\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/nativewebview.png)\\n\\n### [NativeWebView](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.NativeWebView)\\n\\nLastly this month we released a small update for the Native WebView extension to fix some focus issues on Android with the web view and the latest AIR SDK releases.\\n\\nIf you are using this extension it is worth updating just to ensure the focus works correctly particularly if you are managing key inputs and overriding the back key operation on Android. \\n\\n---\\n\\nAs always, if you have any native development needs for AIR, Unity, Flutter or Haxe, please feel free to contact us at [airnativeextensions@distriqt.com](mailto:airnativeextensions@distriqt.com)."},{"id":"2022-10","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2022-10","source":"@site/news/2022-10-30-october-news.md","title":"October 2022","description":"Extension Updates","date":"2022-10-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"newsletter","permalink":"/news/tags/newsletter"},{"inline":true,"label":"inappbilling","permalink":"/news/tags/inappbilling"},{"inline":true,"label":"google-play-billing","permalink":"/news/tags/google-play-billing"}],"readingTime":1.77,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Michael","title":"Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/marchbold","imageURL":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4","key":"marchbold","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2022-10","title":"October 2022","description":"Extension Updates","image":"images/playbilling.png","authors":["marchbold"],"tags":["newsletter","inappbilling","google-play-billing"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"November 2022","permalink":"/news/2022-11"},"nextItem":{"title":"InAppBilling v14","permalink":"/news/2022/10/07/inappbilling-v14-update"}},"content":"> Play Billing v5 release, IronSource updates\\n\\nThis last month has seen the release of the major update for our InAppBilling extension to support the latest version of the play billing library from Google for the Play Store.

Recent AIR SDK updates has meant we can finally bring a much more recent version of the Facebook SDK to AIR developers on iOS which should be a welcome update to anyone who uses Facebook social or login features in their application. The API has remained unchanged but internally it will be using a much more recent version of the SDK. \\n\\nAdditionally some critical fixes were released including fixing an issue with session not persisting across launches on iOS. \\n\\n---\\n\\n![](images/firebase.png)\\n\\n### Firebase\\n\\nThis update brings an update to the iOS SDK. Similar to the Facebook extension, recent updates to the AIR SDK has meant we can now bring a more recent version of the Firebase SDK to iOS developers. This should bring a range of bug fixes and improvements to the underlying Firebase SDK.\\n\\nFirebase Storage extension now provides the ability to [list files](/docs/firebase/storage/list-files) that you have stored in your storage bucket:\\n\\n```actionscript\\nvar ref:StorageReference = FirebaseStorage.service.getReference();\\nref.addEventListener( StorageReferenceListEvent.SUCCESS, listSuccessHandler );\\nref.addEventListener( StorageReferenceListEvent.ERROR, listErrorHandler );\\nref.listAll();\\n\\nfunction listSuccessHandler( event:StorageReferenceListEvent ):void \\n{\\n    // Contains a list of \\"items\\" - each represents a storage item \\n    for each (var item:String in event.items)\\n    {\\n        var ref:StorageReference \\n          = FirebaseStorage.service.getReference( item );\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n![](images/firebase-messaging.png)\\n\\n### Push Notifications\\n\\nThe FCM implementation has been brought inline with the latest Firebase extension bringing a recent version iOS and Android Firebase SDK. This should bring some bug fixes and improvements from the underlying Firebase Messaging SDK:\\n\\n- Android v23.0.0\\n- iOS v8.15.0\\n\\nThe OneSignal SDK has also been updated and now includes v4.7.3 on Android. \\n\\nThis update also brings a range of bug fixes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n![](images/admob.png)\\n\\n### Adverts\\n\\nVersion 13.6 brings version 9+ of the AdMob iOS SDK which includes some significant changes to the SDK.

Previously these have had default values applied by the SDK but with Android 12 Google now requires us to define a specific value for this flag. If you are using APM then this should be a simple update call, otherwise we are updating all our documentation with the new manifest additions which you can apply when you move to targeting API 31.\\n\\nUpdating Google Play Services always is a big job for us. They reach into many of our extensions and all of them must be updated simultaneously to ensure they all work together. We have completed the Google Play Services updates internally and are working through our extensions to ensure compatibility and updating documentation as required.\\n\\n> Now is a great time to consider moving to apm before these updates arrive, in order to simplify your update process!

You should see a decent performance increase if you are dealing with large data queries.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs always, if you have any native development needs for AIR, Unity, Flutter or Haxe, please feel free to contact us at [airnativeextensions@distriqt.com](mailto:airnativeextensions@distriqt.com)."},{"id":"2021-08","metadata":{"permalink":"/news/2021-08","source":"@site/news/2021-08-31-august-news.md","title":"August 2021","description":"APM, Adverts, Android 30, AIR Config","date":"2021-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"newsletter","permalink":"/news/tags/newsletter"},{"inline":true,"label":"air","permalink":"/news/tags/air"},{"inline":true,"label":"apm","permalink":"/news/tags/apm"},{"inline":true,"label":"adverts","permalink":"/news/tags/adverts"},{"inline":true,"label":"android-30","permalink":"/news/tags/android-30"}],"readingTime":4.26,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Michael","title":"Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/marchbold","imageURL":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/442356?s=460&v=4","key":"marchbold","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2021-08","title":"August 2021","description":"APM, Adverts, Android 30, AIR Config","image":"images/airpackagemanager.png","authors":["marchbold"],"tags":["newsletter","air","apm","adverts","android-30"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"September 2021","permalink":"/news/2021-09"},"nextItem":{"title":"July 2021","permalink":"/news/2021-07"}},"content":"> APM, Adverts and Android 30\\n\\nAnother big month, APM is moving along quickly and our first version of manifest merging has been added!

Flurry SDK has been updated and the new \\"standard events\\" added. CameraUI has had some major changes integrated to support Android 30, and the Scanner extension had some bug fixes released.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n![](images/adobeair.png)\\n\\n### AIR SDK Configuration\\n\\nWhile working with apm we have been investigating options to make development using the AIR SDK easier and have come across some concerns around configuration of the SDK.\\n\\nBasically I\'m concerned about the configuration options for a project being placed inside the SDK. I believe this is a really bad practice and that we need to have a more consistent approach for configuration settings. I have raised our concerns on the AIR discussion forum and I think it\'s important as a community that we push a direction for Harman here, before they take the SDK down a bad path.\\n\\nPlease take the time to have a read and let Harman know about where you think the configuration options should be placed.\\n\\nYou can find the discussion here: [https://github.com/airsdk/Adobe-Runtime-Support/discussions/1112](https://github.com/airsdk/Adobe-Runtime-Support/discussions/1112)\\n\\n![](images/airpackagemanager.png)\\n\\n### [AIR Package Manager](https://github.com/airsdk/apm)\\n\\nWe have rolled out several more iterations of the `apm` tool and we have made amazing progress around generation of the application descriptor, most importantly the **automatic generation of the manifest additions for Android**.\\n\\nI seriously cannot emphasise enough how much this will change integrating packages in AIR applications.\\n\\nIt makes adding a new package (extension) to your application as easy as:\\n\\n```\\napm install com.distriqt.CameraUI\\napm generate app-descriptor\\n```\\n\\nAnd your application descriptor will automatically have the manifest additions and extension id\'s inserted, not only for the CameraUI extension but **all the dependencies**!\\n\\nThis is still a work in progress (eg we haven\'t completed iOS merging yet) and we are working hard on getting all our extensions available as packages, but we would really welcome any feedback.\\n\\nFor example, a basic app descriptor after running the above:\\n\\n```\\n<application xmlns=\\"http://ns.adobe.com/air/application/33.1\\">\\n  <id>com.my.app</id>\\n  <versionNumber>1.0.0</versionNumber>\\n  <filename>MyApplication</filename>\\n  <name>My Application</name>\\n  <initialWindow>\\n    <content>[]</content>\\n    <visible>true</visible>\\n    <fullScreen>false</fullScreen>\\n    <autoOrients>false</autoOrients>\\n    <renderMode>direct</renderMode>\\n  </initialWindow>\\n  <android>\\n    <manifestAdditions><![CDATA[<manifest android:installLocation=\\"auto\\" >\\n  <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=\\"19\\" android:targetSdkVersion=\\"30\\"/>\\n  <uses-permission android:name=\\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\\"/>\\n  <uses-permission android:name=\\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\\"/>\\n  <application android:appComponentFactory=\\"androidx.core.app.CoreComponentFactory\\" android:hardwareAccelerated=\\"true\\">\\n    <provider android:name=\\"androidx.lifecycle.ProcessLifecycleOwnerInitializer\\" android:authorities=\\"air.com.my.app.lifecycle-process\\" android:exported=\\"false\\" android:multiprocess=\\"true\\"/>\\n    <provider android:name=\\"androidx.startup.InitializationProvider\\" android:authorities=\\"air.com.my.app.androidx-startup\\" android:exported=\\"false\\"/>\\n    <provider android:name=\\"com.distriqt.extension.cameraui.content.FileProvider\\" android:authorities=\\"air.com.my.app.camerauifileprovider\\" android:exported=\\"false\\" android:grantUriPermissions=\\"true\\">\\n      <meta-data android:name=\\"android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS\\" android:resource=\\"@xml/distriqt_cameraui_paths\\"/>\\n    </provider>\\n    <activity android:name=\\"com.distriqt.extension.cameraui.permissions.AuthorisationActivity\\" android:theme=\\"@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar\\"/>\\n  </application>\\n</manifest>\\n]]></manifestAdditions>\\n    <containsVideo>true</containsVideo>\\n  </android>\\n  <extensions>\\n    <extensionID>androidx.core</extensionID>\\n    <extensionID>com.distriqt.CameraUI</extensionID>\\n    <extensionID>com.distriqt.Core</extensionID>\\n  </extensions>\\n</application>\\n```\\n\\nCurrently we have the following air packages available:\\n\\n- All the Google Play Services\\n- All the androidx and android dependencies\\n- Square libs\\n- Camera UI\\n- Flurry\\n- Adverts (including mediators)\\n\\n#### Get Involved\\n\\nThis tool is for the community, so we really want your feedback. It is opensource and publicly available now. If you are at all interested in testing out the client we are looking for any and all feedback!

Additionally the UMP SDK has been updated to version 2.0.0.\\n\\nExcitingly this extension has been released as an airpackage. This means you can use `apm` to install and generate the manifest additions for you.\\n\\n```\\napm install com.distriqt.Adverts\\napm project config set adMobAndroidApplicationId XXXXXXX\\napm project config set adMobIOSApplicationId YYYYYYY\\n```\\n\\n![](images/android.png)\\n\\n### Android 30\\n\\nNow that the AIR SDK supports Android 30 we have been updating all our extensions to support this latest iteration of the Android platform.

Features would include: connected / disconnected events, input buttons / axis events, and retrieving controller information such as such as type / provider / vendor.\\n\\nYou can read the discussion [here](https://forum.starling-framework.org/d/23008-gamepad-controller-support-iosandroid/18)\\n\\nSponsoring helps us to fund the initial development work for a new extension and is the simplest way we can continue further development of the AIR platform. We have had a large contribution to the development but are still looking for additional funding to get this extension started.
