Now that Google are encouraging mobile to use Firebase the process of creating tracking ids for use only with Google Analytics in mobile applications is slightly confusing.

In order to use this ANE without Firebase follow the instructions below to create your tracking id. Basically you create a "website" tracker and use that id:

1. Sign in to your [Google Analytics account](https://www.google.com/analytics/web/#home/).
2. Click **Admin**.
3. In the *PROPERTY* column, select **Create new property** from the dropdown menu.
4. Select Website.
5. Provide a **Website Name**. You may use the name of your app.
6. Provide a **Website URL**. You may use your company URL or the URL for your appâ€™s marketing site.
7. Click **Get Tracking ID**.
8. In the *VIEW* column, select **Create new view** from the dropdown menu.
9. Select **Mobile app**.
10. Provide a **Reporting View Name**.
11. Click **Create View**.
