## Major Update

This update to Play Billing v8 changes the purchases returned via getPurchases / restorePurchases. 
This used to return all historical purchases. Now it will only return active purchases and you are 
expected to track historical purchases yourself or use the server API.

[Recommendations](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/query-purchase-history):
 - Handle Voided Purchases: To fetch voided or cancelled purchases, use the [voided purchases](https://developers.google.com/android-publisher/voided-purchases) server developer API.
 - Track Historical Purchases: If your app would like to track a user's purchase history your app should keep track of the history on your apps backend.

This update also includes an update to the Amazon Appstore integration, bringing the latest SDK and bug fixes.

### Updates

feat(playbilling): update playbilling sdk v8.0.0 (resolves https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-InAppBilling/issues/654)
feat(amazon): update amazon appstore sdk v3.0.8 (https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-InAppBilling/issues/658)
```

### 2025.07.25 [v17.1.0]

```
## Major Update

This latest update integrates **Google Play Billing v7** bringing support for **Android API v35**. (This is a required update before the end of August 2025.) 

**This release brings a refactoring of the extension around products and purchases events.** The purpose here is to reduce the ambiguity of the `InAppBillingEvent` that was previously used to handle all events and to provide a more consistent API for handling purchases and products.

This update also includes a major update to the **Samsung IAP** integration. The SDK has been updated to v6.4.0 which includes a range of internal changes. Purchases now need to be acknowledged which is completed when through the normal process of calling `finishPurchase()`. There have been some internal changes to offers with usage of the "promotion eligibility" checks that are performed when retrieving the product list.
