Updating your application descriptor will insert the required `extensionID`'s and generate the manifest and info additions for your application. 

You update your application descriptor by running:

```
apm generate app-descriptor src/MyApp-app.xml
```

Change the path (`src/MyApp-app.xml`) to point to your application descriptor.

:::caution
This will modify your application descriptor replacing the manifest additions and info additions with the ones generated from `apm`. 

You should backup your application descriptor before running this command to ensure you don't lose any information.

If you need to insert custom data into these sections see the guides for [Android](https://github.com/airsdk/apm/wiki/Usage-Generate#android) and [iOS](https://github.com/airsdk/apm/wiki/Usage-Generate#ios)

### Writing to the Camera Roll

If you need to write to the camera roll on Android versions < 29 then you will also need to add the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission to your manifest.

Create a custom config for Android by running:

```
apm generate config android
```

Then edit the file at `config/android/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following permission.

```xml
<!-- OPTIONAL: Only add this one if you want to add to the camera roll -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" android:maxSdkVersion="28" />
```

Once complete regenerate your app descriptor (as above).
