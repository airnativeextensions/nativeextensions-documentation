## About

Account Kit helps people quickly and easily register and log into your app using 
their phone number or email address as a passwordless credential. Account Kit is 
powered by Facebook's email and SMS sending infrastructure for reliable scalable 
performance with global reach. Using email and phone number authentication doesn't 
require a Facebook account, and is the ideal alternative to a social login.
