v4.3 brings a newer approach to communications between applications on Android and a simplified manifest.  

Previously you had to add a `provider` line in your `queries` for each application you required to communicate to meaning you had to define all your applications before publishing. The new approach uses just the single application group, adding just one `intent` to the `queries` tag, this can be done automatically by `apm` or unity's build scripts for your application.

To migrate you'll simply need to update your manifest to reflect this new approach. 

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
    {label: 'Unity', value: 'unity'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >

If you are using [`apm`](https://github.com/airsdk/apm) all you need to do is update to the latest build and regenerate your application descriptor. `apm` will handle the rest.

```
apm update 
apm generate app-descriptor src/Main-app.xml
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >

If you are manually managing your application descriptor (and manifest additions) then you will be required to download the latest extensions and add them to your application descriptor. 

Then update your manifest as per the documentation in the getting started guide.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="unity" >

With Unity ensure you have set the configuration items in your `AppGroupDefaultsConfig.cs` file and then rebuild your application. 
The manifest should automatically be updated with the newer `queries` tag.

You can confirm by checking the AndroidManifest.xml generated in your build.
