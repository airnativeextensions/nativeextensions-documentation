### Extension IDs

The following should be added to your `extensions` node in your application descriptor to identify all the required ANEs in your application:

```xml
<extensions>
	<extensionID>com.distriqt.facebook.Core</extensionID>
	<extensionID>com.distriqt.facebook.Login</extensionID>

	<extensionID>com.distriqt.Core</extensionID>
	<extensionID>com.distriqt.Bolts</extensionID>

	<extensionID>androidx.appcompat</extensionID>
	<extensionID>androidx.browser</extensionID>
	<extensionID>androidx.cardview</extensionID>
	<extensionID>androidx.core</extensionID>
	<extensionID>androidx.emoji2</extensionID>
	<extensionID>androidx.vectordrawable</extensionID>
	<extensionID>com.android.installreferrer</extensionID>

</extensions>
```



### Android

#### Manifest Additions

The Facebook Login extension doesn't require any manifest additions beyond the ones you have added for the Facebook Core extension.


### iOS 

#### Dynamic Frameworks

Facebook is based on a dynamic framework so you must include the framework and dependent swift libs in your application for signing by AIR.

To do this create a `Frameworks` directory at the top / root level of your application and ensure it is packaged with your AIR application.

If should contain any of the files in the supplied `Frameworks` directory (including `dylib` and `framework` directories) and any of the Facebook SDK components that you are using in your application.

The Core extension requires several frameworks so your `Frameworks` directory should contain:

```
FBAEMKit.framework
FBSDKCoreKit_Basics.framework
FBSDKCoreKit.framework
FBSDKLoginKit.framework
```


#### Info Additions

The Facebook Login extension doesn't require any info additions beyond the ones you have added for the Facebook Core extension.
