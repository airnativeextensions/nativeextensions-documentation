### Extension IDs

The following should be added to your `extensions` node in your application descriptor to identify all the required ANEs in your application:

```xml
<extensions>
    <extensionID>com.distriqt.IDFA</extensionID>
    <extensionID>com.distriqt.Core</extensionID>

    <extensionID>com.distriqt.playservices.Base</extensionID>
    <extensionID>com.distriqt.playservices.AdsIdentifier</extensionID>

    <extensionID>androidx.core</extensionID>
</extensions>
```



### Android 

#### Manifest Additions 

You need to make sure you add the `android.permission.INTERNET` permission and the 
`com.google.android.gms.version` tags to your manifest additions as below:


```xml
<manifest android:installLocation="auto">
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    
    <application>

        <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.version" android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />

    </application>
</manifest>
```



### iOS 

:::note iOS SDK
This ANE has been updated for iOS 14 and requires a minimum of the iOS 14 SDK to be linked with your application in order to have access to the iOS 14 app tracking transparency features.

Make sure you provide a valid iOS 14+ SDK when packaging. Currently you do this by packaging with the iOS SDK, see [here](/docs/tutorials/ios-sdk-custom) for more.

**This is not required if you are using AIR 33+ as it contains a recent version of the iOS SDK.**

#### Info Additions

You must specify the usage descriptions for authorisation dialog by adding the following string to your InfoAdditions:

```xml
<key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
<string>This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you.</string>
```

You can customise the value of this string as you require for your application.

This should be added to the Info Additions node :

```xml
<iPhone>
    <InfoAdditions><![CDATA[

        <key>NSUserTrackingUsageDescription</key>
        <string>This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you.</string>

    ]]></InfoAdditions>
    <requestedDisplayResolution>high</requestedDisplayResolution>
    <Entitlements>
        <![CDATA[
        ]]>
    </Entitlements>
</iPhone>
```
