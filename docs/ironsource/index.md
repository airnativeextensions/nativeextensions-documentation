# IronSource

IronSource is an AIR Native Extension to access the [IronSource](https://www.ironsrc.com/) advertising SDK for in app monetisation.

>
> The biggest game developers in the industry trust ironSource with their app businesses because we provide everything they need in one powerful platform.
>


IronSource does provide an ANE independent of this ANE. We developed this ANE so we can update the ANE to match the latest native versions without waiting for updates from IronSource directly, which seem to lag behind the native SDKs.
