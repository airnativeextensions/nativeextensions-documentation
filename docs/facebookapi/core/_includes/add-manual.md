The following guide is used to manually install the extension, download dependencies and update the application descriptor. We highly recommend installing extensions using `apm`. Using `apm` will automate the installation and automatically handle updates and dependencies along with greatly simplifying the application descriptor generation.
:::


First step is always to add the extension to your development environment. Download the extension from the repository and then follow the tutorial located [here](/docs/tutorials/getting-started) to add the extension to your development environment.



### Dependencies

Many of our extensions use some common libraries, for example, the Android Support libraries.

We have to separate these libraries into separate extensions in order to avoid multiple versions of the libraries being included in your application and causing packaging conflicts. This means that you need to include some additional extensions in your application along with the main extension file.

You will add these extensions as you do with any other extension, and you need to ensure it is packaged with your application.


#### Core 

The Core extension is required by this extension. You must include this extension in your application.

This extension requires you call the `init()` function at some point early in your application, generally at the same time as the initialisation of this extension. If you are using other extensions that also require the Core extension, you only need to initialise it once, before initialising any of our extensions.

```actionscript
Core.init();
```

The Core extension doesn't provide any functionality in itself but provides support libraries and frameworks used by our extensions.
It also includes some centralised code for some common actions that can cause issues if they are implemented in each individual extension.

You can access this extension here: [https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Core](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Core).


#### Bolts

The Bolts extension is required by Facebook.

The Bolts extension doesn't provide any functionality in itself but supports some of our other extensions.
It contains the Bolts framework.

You can access this extension here: [https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Bolts](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Bolts).


#### Android Support

The Android Support libraries encompass the Android Support, Android X and common Google libraries. 

These libraries are specific to Android. There are no issues including these on all platforms, they are just **required** for Android.

This extension requires the following extensions:

- [androidx.appcompat](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.appcompat.ane)
- [androidx.browser](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.browser.ane)
- [androidx.cardview](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.cardview.ane)
- [androidx.core](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.core.ane)
- [androidx.emoji2](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.emoji2.ane)
- [androidx.vectordrawable](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/androidx.vectordrawable.ane)
- [com.android.installreferrer](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.android.installreferrer.ane)
- [com.jetbrains.kotlin](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.jetbrains.kotlin.ane)

You can access these extensions here: [https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport).


>
> **Note**: if you have been using the older `com.distriqt.androidsupport.*` (Android Support) extensions you should remove these extensions and replace it with the `androidx` extensions listed above. This is the new version of the android support libraries and moving forward all our extensions will require AndroidX.
