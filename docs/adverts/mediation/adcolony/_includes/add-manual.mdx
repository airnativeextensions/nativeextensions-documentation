The `com.distriqt.admob.AdColony` ANE includes the AdColony SDK and the AdMob AdColony mediation adapter. This is everything you need to get AdColony mediation working in your application.

To add the ANE download it from the repository and add it to your application:

- [`com.distriqt.admob.AdColony`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Adverts-Mediation/raw/master/lib/adcolony/com.distriqt.admob.AdColony.ane)
