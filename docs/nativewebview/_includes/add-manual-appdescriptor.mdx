### Extension IDs

The following should be added to your `extensions` node in your application descriptor to identify all the required ANEs in your application:

```xml
<extensions>
    <extensionID>com.distriqt.NativeWebView</extensionID>
    <extensionID>com.distriqt.Core</extensionID>

    <!-- ANDROID -->
    <extensionID>androidx.browser</extensionID>
    <extensionID>androidx.core</extensionID>

</extensions>
```



### Android

#### Manifest Additions


The NativeWebView will require a small addition to the manifest to be able to browse for files.
If you are looking to play videos in your webpage on Android we highly recommend adding the 
`android:hardwareAccelerated="true"` flag to your application. 

You should make sure your manifest contains the following:

```xml
<manifest android:installLocation="auto">
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>

    <queries>
        <intent>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
            <data android:scheme="https" />
        </intent>
        <intent>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
            <data android:scheme="http" />
        </intent>
    </queries>

    <!-- android:hardwareAccelerated is highly recommended for video playback and scroll performance -->
    <!-- android:windowSoftInputMode is used to push the content up when an input appears below the keyboard -->
    <application 
        android:hardwareAccelerated="true"
        android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
            
        <activity 
            android:name="com.distriqt.extension.nativewebview.activities.BrowseActivity" 
            android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar" 
			android:exported="false" />

        <activity 
            android:name="com.distriqt.extension.nativewebview.permissions.AuthorisationActivity" 
            android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar"
			android:exported="false" />

    </application>
</manifest>
```



### iOS

#### InfoAdditions

Since iOS 9, Apple has introduced the concept of App Transport Security (ATS). is encouraging the use of HTTPS

App Transport Security (ATS) lets an app add a declaration to its Info.plist file that specifies 
the domains with which it needs secure communication. ATS prevents accidental disclosure, provides 
secure default behaviour, and is easy to adopt. You should adopt ATS as soon as possible, regardless 
of whether you're creating a new app or updating an existing one. 

If you're developing a new app, you should use HTTPS exclusively. If you have an existing app, you 
should use HTTPS as much as you can right now, and create a plan for migrating the rest of your app 
as soon as possible.

In simple terms, this means that if your application attempts to connect to any HTTP server 
(in this example, `yourserver.com`) that doesnâ€™t support the latest SSL technology (TLSv1.2), 
your connections will fail with an error.

Basically the repercussions mean that you will need to add exceptions in for any non secure domain 
you access. For example the following adds an exception for the `yourserver.com` domain and subdomains.

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
  <dict>
    <key>yourserver.com</key>
    <dict>
      <!--Include to allow subdomains-->
      <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
      <true/>
      <!--Include to allow HTTP requests-->
      <key>NSTemporaryExceptionAllowsInsecureHTTPLoads</key>
      <true/>
    </dict>
  </dict>
</dict>
```
