Note: All of the commands below should be run in a terminal / command prompt in the root directory of your application, generally the level above your source directory.
:::

import SetupAPM from '../../_includes/apm/setup-apm.mdx'

<SetupAPM />


### Install the extension 

Install the extension by running: 

```
apm install com.distriqt.Health
```

If you are looking to use Google Fitness use the `com.distriqt.Health-Fitness` variant to ensure the dependencies for Google Fitness are installed.

This will download and install the extension, required assets, and all dependencies.

Once complete `apm` will have created something like the following file structure: 

```
.
|____ ane
| |____ com.distriqt.Health.ane	    # Health extension
| |____ [dependencies]
|____ apm_packages					# cache directory - ignore
|____ project.apm					# apm project file
```

- Add the `ane` directory to your IDE. *See the tutorials located [here](/docs/tutorials/getting-started) on adding an extension to your IDE.*


:::info
We suggest you use the locations directly in your builds rather than copying the files elsewhere. The reason for this is if you ever go to update the extensions using `apm` that these updates will be pulled into your build automatically.
:::


- You will need to set the configuration values for usage in the extension. Call the following to step through the configuration values for this extension:

```
apm project config set com.distriqt.Health
```


#### Google Fitness

If you are using Google Fitness, you will need to install the `com.distriqt.Health-Fitness` variant of the extension. This will ensure that the required dependencies for Google Fitness are installed.

The default `com.distriqt.Health` variant does not include the Google Fitness dependencies.

```
apm install com.distriqt.Health-Fitness
```

:::caution
You must only install one of the variants, either `com.distriqt.Health` or `com.distriqt.Health-Fitness`, not both.
