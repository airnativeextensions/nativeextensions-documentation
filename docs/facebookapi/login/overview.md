When people log into your app with Facebook they can grant permissions to your app so you can retrieve information or perform actions on Facebook on their behalf.

If people don't have the Facebook app installed, Facebook Login uses Facebook Lite instead to display the login screen and get credentials. Previous SDKs required that people have the Facebook app installed.
