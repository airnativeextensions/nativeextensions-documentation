The simplest way to install and manage your AIR native extensions and libraries is to use the AIR Package Manager (`apm`). We highly recommend using `apm`, as it will handle downloading all required dependencies and manage your application descriptor (Android manifest additions, iOS info additions etc).

However you can choose to install it manually, as you would have done in the past. 


:::info AIR SDK
This ANE currently requires at least AIR 33+. This is required in order to support versions of Android > 9.0 (API 28). We always recommend using the most recent build with AIR especially for mobile development where the OS changes rapidly.

## Install

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<InstallAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<InstallManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>


## Application Descriptor

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<AppDescriptorAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<AppDescriptorManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>


### Background Updates


#### Android 

On Android, if you require access to the location data in the background or if you are using geofences then you must also add the background permission:

```xml
<!-- NEEDED FOR BACKGROUND LOCATION AND GEOFENCES -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
```


<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
  
To add this you need to add some additional configuration to apm. Firstly add a custom Android configuration file by running:

```
apm generate config android
```

Edit the `config/android/AndroidManifest.xml` file that was generated to resemble the following, adding the required permissions, i.e.:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">

	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />

</manifest>
```

Once you have added this configuration run the steps above to update / generate your [application descriptor](#application-descriptor).

You can add any other additions you require in your application here and these will be merged by `apm` when you generate your application descriptor. 


  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >

If you require access to the location data in the background or if you are using geofences then you must also add the background permission:

```xml
<!-- NEEDED FOR BACKGROUND LOCATION AND GEOFENCES -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION" />
```


  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>





#### iOS 

If you are planning to setup your application to receive background updates then you should include the `UIBackgroundModes` key, (however it is not required). 
If it is enabled, you will be able to receive updates in the background to trigger an event when your application is running in the background 
(and you have been granted the `ALWAYS` authorisation by the user, see later). If you don't add it, then you will only receive the updates when the application is running in the foreground. 

Currently due to an AIR bug we can't receive location updates on iOS when the application isn't running. This is due to a bug where AIR applications cannot "start into the background" on iOS.


<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
  
To add these additions you need to add some additional configuration. Firstly add a custom iOS configuration file by running:

```
apm generate config ios
```

Edit the `config/ios/InfoAdditions.xml` file that was generated to resemble the following, adding the `UIBackgroundModes` node:

```xml
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>

    <!-- Required if you wish to receive background location updates -->
    <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
    <array>
        <string>location</string>
    </array>

    </dict>
</plist>
```

Once you have added this configuration run the steps above to update / generate your [application descriptor](#application-descriptor).

You can add any other additions you require in your application here and these will be merged by `apm` when you generate your application descriptor. 

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >

To add these additions you need to add some additional configuration. 
Then edit your info additions in your application descriptor to add the following: 

```xml
<iPhone>
		<InfoAdditions><![CDATA[
        
        <!-- Required if you wish to receive background location updates -->
        <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
        <array>
            <string>location</string>
        </array>

        <!-- Other additions here -->

    ]]></InfoAdditions>
</iPhone>
        
```

  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>

:::note
If your application requires locations services to run then you should also add the following to your info additions:
```xml
<!-- Add this if your application needs location services to run -->
<key>UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities</key>
<array>
    <string>location-services</string>
</array> 
```
