## Adding Permissions 

To request a permisison you must firstly have added these permissions you require to your application's manifest.

Permissions are represented with a tag like the following:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

A complete list of the possible permissions is found [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission).


<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
    {label: 'Unity', value: 'unity'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >

To add these permissions you need to add some additional configuration to apm. 
Firstly add a custom Android configuration file by running:

```
apm generate config android
```

Edit the `config/android/AndroidManifest.xml` file that was generated to resemble the following, adding the required permissions, eg:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">

	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />

</manifest>
```

You can add any other additions you require in your application here and these will be merged by `apm` when you generate your application descriptor.

:::info
Make sure you regenerate your application descriptor after modifying this file. See the section in [add the extension](add-the-extension.mdx#application-descriptor) for details.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >

To manually add permissions to your application, you will need to edit the manifest additions node in your application descriptor. 
For example, to add the camera permission:


```xml
<android>
  <manifestAdditions><![CDATA[
    <manifest android:installLocation="auto">

      <!-- PERMISSIONS -->
      <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />


      <!-- OTHER MANIFEST ADDITIONS -->


    </manifest>
  ]]></manifestAdditions>
</android>
```


  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="unity" >

There are several methods to add entries to the android manifest in Unity. 
If you already have a preferred approach, you can simply add the permissions you require to your manifest, eg:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

The approach we prefer is to create a folder in your `Assets` folder something like `Project.androidlib`, (you can create this in a subfolder like `Plugins/Android` to keep things organised).

Create a file in this directory called `project.properties` and add the following contents:

```
android.library=true
```

Then create an `AndroidManifests.xml` file and add the additions you need:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" package="project.packagename.resources">

	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />

</manifest>
```

Unity will merge the contents of this file into your applications manifest during a build.
