The following guide is used to manually install the extension, download dependencies and update the application descriptor. We highly recommend installing extensions using `apm`. Using `apm` will automate the installation and automatically handle updates and dependencies along with greatly simplifying the application descriptor generation.

The `com.distriqt.admob.Mintegral` ANE includes the Mintegral SDK and the AdMob Mintegral mediation adapter. This is everything you need to get Mintegral mediation working in your application.

To add the ANE download it from the repository and add it to your application:

- [`com.distriqt.admob.Mintegral`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Adverts-Mediation/raw/master/lib/applovin/com.distriqt.admob.Mintegral.ane)

More information on adding ANEs in this [tutorial](/docs/tutorials/getting-started)
