title: Migrating to version 16.1
---


The latest release updates the AdMob library to the latest releases:
- Android: `24.2.0`
- iOS: `12.12.0`

UMP:
- Android: `3.2.0`
- iOS: `3.0.0`

The implementation remains mainly unchanged apart from the notes below.


## Android Gradle Version 

We have updated the required gradle version used to build your application to be higher than the default AIR currently uses. 

To specify a higher version add the following to your android node in your application descriptor:

```xml
<android>
    <gradleVersion>8.9</gradleVersion>
    <androidGradlePluginVersion>8.7.3</androidGradlePluginVersion>

  ...
</android>
```

If you don't do this you will see the following error when building your application:

```
Unexpected failure: Unable to run java: com.adobe.air.ADTException: gradle tool failed: 
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

...

   > BUG! exception in phase 'semantic analysis' in source unit '_BuildScript_' Unsupported class file major version 65
```

:::note
April 2025: This is not currently automatically handled by `apm` so you will need to add this manually to your application descriptor.

We are working on an update to handle this.

## UMP Updates

We have updated the UMP implementation to the latest version which is now `3.2.0` on Android and `3.0.0` on iOS. 
This provides a number of bug fixes and improvements to the UMP implementation.

The major addition is the ability to present the privacy form directly.

```actionscript
var privacyStatus:String = Adverts.service.ump.getConsentInformation().getPrivacyOptionsRequirementStatus();
if (PrivacyOptionsRequirementStatus.REQUIRED == privacyStatus)
{
    Adverts.service.ump.addEventListener( UserMessagingPlatformEvent.PRIVACY_OPTIONS_FORM_DISMISSED, ump_showFormDismissedHandler );
    Adverts.service.ump.showPrivacyOptionsForm();
}
```
