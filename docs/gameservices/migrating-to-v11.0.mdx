title: Migrating to v11.0

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'


This latest release brings an update to the Google Play Games v2 SDK to the latest version (v21.0.0).


## Android Integration 

The update is fairly simple however you will have to remove to the `com.distriqt.playservices.Drive` dependency as it has been included in the `com.distriqt.playservices.Gamesv2` dependency now.

If you are using `apm` or manually managing your application you will have to manually remove the extension entry from your application descriptor. 

i.e. remove the following entry from your application descriptor:

```xml
<extensionID>com.distriqt.playservices.Drive</extensionID>
```
