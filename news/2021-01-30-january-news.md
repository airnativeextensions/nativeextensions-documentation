> Firebase, Facebook, Advertising, Game Services and more…

We are starting the year with a series of updates for some of our biggest extensions. With the privacy changes for IDFA in iOS 14 looming a lot of the advertising SDKs have been updated to get ready for this change. We have updates for AdMob and IronSource available to supposedly address these changes.

A lot of updates to start the year, so please let us know if there are any concerns about updating the extensions. We have migration guides available where the changes are significant so look for those in the documentation.

### [Facebook Gaming Services](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.FacebookAPI)


We have released a new extension in the Facebook group that provides access to the Gaming Services SDK. The Gaming Services SDK allows applications configured as games through Facebook to access certain game specific functionality, including a simpler login process and additional native dialogs.

This new extension includes access to the Game Request dialog and Friend Finder dialog.

This release also includes an update of the Facebook SDK to version 8.2.0.

Available now in the Facebook API extension.

See the push notifications [migration guide](https://docs.airnativeextensions.com/docs/pushnotifications/migrating-to-v10.1).

### [Game Services](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.GameServices)

Updated to the latest Google Play Games to v21.0.0. As part of this release Google’s deprecated multiplayer functionality and has been completely disabled. So we have removed all this functionality from the extension and correctly report it not being supported on Google Play Games.

Turn based multiplayer is still available in Game Center.
