# Media Player 

The [MediaPlayer](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.MediaPlayer) 
extension allows developers to display a native video player in your application.

This extension provides functionality to display and control the native media player. 
Using the native media player gives you native performance and standard controls for 
playback of device supported media. The simple API allows you to quickly integrate 
video and audio playback in your AIR application in just a few lines of code. 
Identical code base can be used across all platforms allowing you to concentrate on 
your application and not device specifics.

The extension provides the ability to create, position, resize and control playback 
of media. It supports all formats that the native video player supports, which does 
vary slightly between platforms. Using native functionality to playback video will 
significantly increase the performance of the playback.

It provides both a media/video player with UI and an audio player (without UI).

We provide complete guides to get you up and running with dialogs quickly and easily.
