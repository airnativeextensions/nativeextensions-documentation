# IronSource

ironSource is an AIR Native Extension to access the [ironSource](https://www.is.com/) advertising SDK for in app monetisation.

We developed this extension so we can update it to match the latest native versions without waiting for updates from IronSource directly, which seem to be given a lower priority and lag behind the native SDKs.
