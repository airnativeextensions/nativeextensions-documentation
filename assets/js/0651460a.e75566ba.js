This makes it easy for you to encode each move as the starting and ending position of the piece moved. The rest of the data (who made the moves) can be completely inferred. When your game loads the match data, it quickly replays the moves to generate the current board position.\nThis strategy works best for games with a small number of possible kinds of actions and a small number of moves per match. Also, with this model, it is very possible for your game to replay the moves in its user interface, allowing players to see exactly what moves other opponents made to get the board into the new state.

This is particularly true for very complex games where the list of moves might grow too large to fit in the available storage space. This strategy is recommended as a last resort. Players lose all context of what happened on previous turns of the match.
