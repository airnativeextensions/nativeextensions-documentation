This guide is intended for publishers who want to use the Google Mobile Ads SDK to load and display ads from Facebook Audience Network via mediation.

## Step 1: Set up Facebook Audience Network

The Google documentation contains a very detailed guide as to the process to setup your properties and Facebook account to display adverts.

Make sure you follow this guide closely.

- Android: https://developers.google.com/admob/android/mediation/facebook#step_1_set_up_facebook_audience_network
- iOS: https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/mediation/facebook#step_1_set_up_facebook_audience_network

## Step 2: Configure mediation settings for your AdMob ad unit

You need to add Facebook to the mediation configuration for your ad unit.

- iOS: https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/mediation/facebook#step_2_configure_mediation_settings_for_your_ad_unit

## Step 3: Import the Facebook Audience Network SDK and adapter ANE


The simplest way to install and manage your AIR native extensions and libraries is to use the AIR Package Manager (`apm`). We highly recommend using `apm`, as it will handle downloading all required dependencies and manage your application descriptor (Android manifest additions, iOS info additions etc).

However you can choose to install it manually, as you would have done in the past. 

### Add the Extension

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<InstallAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<InstallManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>


### Application Descriptor

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<AppDescriptorAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<AppDescriptorManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>


## Step 4: Additional code required

There is no additional code required.


## Step 5: Test your implementation

When testing always make sure you are adding your test device id to the request to ensuring AdMob do not block your account for policy violations:

```actionscript
new AdRequestBuilder()
    .addTestDevice( "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" )
    .build()
```

See the Adverts docs for more details.

### Facebook Testing

You will need to enable testing in your Facebook account, by adding your test device and enabling an test advert type to serve the device.

See the [Testing Audience Network Implementation guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/audience-network/testing) for detailed instructions on how to enable Facebook test ads.

### Forcing Mediation Network

The easiest way we have found to force a mediation network during testing is to disable automatic optimisations and set the eCPM manually.

Doing this you can give the mediation network you are wanting to test a high eCPM value ( eg $1000) and all others (including AdMob) a very low eCPM (eg $0.01).
