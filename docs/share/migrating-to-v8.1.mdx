## Read SMS Messages

The Share ANE now supports reading SMS messages on Android. This is a new feature that allows your application to access SMS messages stored on the device.
To read SMS messages, you can use the `Share.service.sms.readSMS()` method. This method returns an array of `SMS` objects representing the SMS messages on the device.



## Android Gradle Version 

We have updated the required gradle version used to build your application to be higher than the default AIR currently uses. 

To specify a higher version add the following to your android node in your application descriptor:

```xml
<android>
    <gradleVersion>8.9</gradleVersion>
    <androidGradlePluginVersion>8.7.3</androidGradlePluginVersion>

  ...
</android>
```

If you don't do this you will see the following error when building your application:

```
Unexpected failure: Unable to run java: com.adobe.air.ADTException: gradle tool failed: 
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

...

   > BUG! exception in phase 'semantic analysis' in source unit '_BuildScript_' Unsupported class file major version 65
```

:::note
April 2025: This is not currently automatically handled by `apm` so you will need to add this manually to your application descriptor.

We are working on an update to handle this.
