# App Group Defaults 

The [AppGroup Defaults](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.AppGroupDefaults) extension provides the ability to be able to share settings in a key-value store between your different applications installed on a users device.

The simple API allows you to quickly integrate saving data. The key-value storage allows you to store discrete values for preferences, configuration, or state variables that need to be shared between applications. Key-value storage is similar to the local user defaults database; but values that you place in key-value storage are available to every application in your group. If one instance of your app changes a value, the other instances see that change and can use it to update their configuration.

We provide complete guides to get you up and running with app group defaults quickly and easily.

It supports both Unity and Adobe AIR frameworks on **iOS** and **Android**, allowing you to use the same functionality on all frameworks and platforms.
