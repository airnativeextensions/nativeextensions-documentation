Note: All of the commands below should be run in a terminal / command prompt in the root directory of your application, generally the level above your source directory.
:::

import SetupAPM from '../../_includes/apm/setup-apm.mdx'

<SetupAPM />


### Install the extension 

Install the extension by running: 

```
apm install com.distriqt.InAppBilling
```

This will download and install the base [variant](#variants) of the extension, including the required assets, and all dependencies.

Once complete `apm` will have created something like the following file structure: 

```
.
|____ ane
| |____ com.distriqt.InAppBilling.ane	# InAppBilling extension
| |____ [dependencies]
|____ apm_packages						# cache directory - ignore
|____ project.apm						# apm project file
```

- Add the `ane` directory to your IDE. *See the tutorials located [here](/docs/tutorials/getting-started) on adding an extension to your IDE.*

:::info
We suggest you use the locations directly in your builds rather than copying the files elsewhere. The reason for this is if you ever go to update the extensions using `apm` that these updates will be pulled into your build automatically.
:::


#### Variants

You will find there are several variants of this extension available and each is listed as a separate package. A variant contains different supported services allowing you to integrate only the services you require in your application.

To install a variant you will need to modify the install command as follows:

```
apm install com.distriqt.InAppBilling-VARIANT
```

For example:

```
apm install com.distriqt.InAppBilling-Amazon
```

See the individual section on each variant for more details.

:::caution
Only install one variant of an package. The base variant is installed when no variant is specified and cannot be included alongside another variant. You will likely get an error if you attempt to install multiple variants with `apm`
