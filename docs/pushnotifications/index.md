# Push Notifications

The [Push Notifications](https://airnativeextensions.com/extension/com.distriqt.PushNotifications) extension allows you to  receive and process push notifications using push notification services.Â 

The simple API will have you up and running with push notifications in just a few lines of code. 
Identical code base can be used across all platforms without any platform specific code, allowing you to develop once and deploy everywhere!

Advanced users have in depth access to permissions, payloads, and even silent notifications. 
You can control how to process the data and how to display the notification including many customisations allowing you to create useful push notifications for your users increasing user engagement and bringing them back to your application.

You can use silent notifications to send information about updates to your application without user interaction, allowing you to update content in the background without affecting your user experience.

You can give users the ability to quickly interact with your application through actions, 
allowing them to do common tasks quickly.

Our extension is completely customisable in notification fields allowing you to change the data fields 
that get processed into a notification on Android, allowing deep integration with other messaging platforms, such as OneSignal.

The simple extension API will have you quickly up and running with remote notifications.

As with all our extensions you get access to a year of support and updates as we are continually 
improving and updating the extensions for OS updates and feature requests.
