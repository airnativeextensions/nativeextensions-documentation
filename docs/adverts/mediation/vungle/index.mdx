This guide is intended for publishers who want to use the Google Mobile Ads SDK to load and display ads from Vungle (Liftoff Monetize) via mediation. 
 It covers how to add Vungle to an ad unit's mediation configuration and how to integrate the Vungle SDK and adapter into an AIR app.

## Step 1: Set up configurations in Vungle UI

https://developers.google.com/admob/android/mediation/vungle#step_1

## Step 2: Set up Vungle demand in AdMob UI

https://developers.google.com/admob/android/mediation/vungle#step-2

## Step 3: Import the Vungle mediation ANE

The simplest way to install and manage your AIR native extensions and libraries is to use the AIR Package Manager (`apm`). 
We highly recommend using `apm`, as it will handle downloading all required dependencies and manage your application descriptor (Android manifest additions, iOS info additions etc).

However you can choose to install it manually, as you would have done in the past. 

### Add the Extension

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<InstallAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<InstallManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>


### Application Descriptor

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<AppDescriptorAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<AppDescriptorManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>


## Step 4: Implement privacy settings on Vungle SDK


### EU consent and GDPR

Under the Google EU User Consent Policy, you must ensure that certain disclosures are given to, and consents obtained from, users in the European Economic Area (EEA) regarding the use of device identifiers and personal data. This policy reflects the requirements of the EU ePrivacy Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). When seeking consent, you must identify each ad network in your mediation chain that may collect, receive, or use personal data and provide information about each network's use. Google currently is unable to pass the user's consent choice to such networks automatically.

Vungle includes an API that lets you pass consent to the Vungle SDK. The following sample code shows how to pass this consent information to the Vungle SDK. If you choose to call this method, it is recommended that you do so prior to requesting ads through the Google Mobile Ads SDK.

```actionscript
Vungle.instance.setGDPRStatus( true, "v1.0.0" );
```

See [GDPR recommended implementation instructions](https://support.vungle.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047780372-Advanced-Settings#gdpr-recommended-implementation-instructions-0-1) for more details and the values that can be provided in the method.


### US states privacy laws

U.S. states privacy laws require giving users the right to opt out of the "sale" of their "personal information" (as the law defines those terms), with the opt-out offered via a prominent "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link on the "selling" party's homepage. The U.S. states privacy laws compliance guide offers the ability to enable restricted data processing for Google ad serving, but Google is unable to apply this setting to each ad network in your mediation chain. Therefore, you must identify each ad network in your mediation chain that may participate in the sale of personal information and follow guidance from each of those networks to ensure compliance.

Vungle includes an API that lets you pass consent to the Vungle SDK. The following sample code shows how to pass this consent information to the Vungle SDK. If you choose to call this method, it is recommended that you do so prior to requesting ads through the Google Mobile Ads SDK.

```actionscript
Vungle.instance.setCCPAStatus( true );
```

See [CCPA implementation](https://support.vungle.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047780372-Advanced-Settings#ccpa-implementation-0-9) for more details and the values that can be provided in the method.


## Step 5: Add required code

No additional code is required for Vungle integration.


## Step 6: Test your implementation

### Enable test ads

Make sure you register your test device for AdMob and [enable test mode](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/mediation/liftoff-monetize#turn-on-test-mode) in Liftoff Monetize UI. 

### Verify test ads

To verify that you are receiving test ads from Liftoff Monetize, enable single ad source testing in ad inspector using the Liftoff Monetize (Bidding) and Liftoff Monetize (Waterfall) ad source(s).
