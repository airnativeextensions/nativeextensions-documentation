**If you don't have an APM project setup, expand the guide below to setup an APM project before installing the extension.**

### Install APM

If you haven't installed `apm` follow the install guide on [airsdk.dev](https://airsdk.dev/docs/basics/install-apm).


### Setup an APM project 

You will need an APM project for your application.


There are many ways to do this and for more options see the [APM documentation](https://github.com/airsdk/apm/wiki/Usage-ProjectsAndPackages#initialise). Here we will just initialise a new empty project:

```
apm init
```

#### Check your github token

We use github to secure our extensions so you must have created a github personal access token and configured `apm` to use it. 

To do this create a token using this [guide from github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) and then set it in your apm config using:

```
apm config set github_token ghp_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

If you don't do this correctly you may find the install will fail.
