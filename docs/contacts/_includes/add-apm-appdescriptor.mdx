Updating your application descriptor will insert the required `extensionID`'s and generate the manifest and info additions for your application. 

You update your application descriptor by running:

```
apm generate app-descriptor src/MyApp-app.xml
```

Change the path (`src/MyApp-app.xml`) to point to your application descriptor.

:::caution
This will modify your application descriptor replacing the manifest additions and info additions with the ones generated from `apm`. 

You should backup your application descriptor before running this command to ensure you don't lose any information.

If you need to insert custom data into these sections see the guides for [Android](https://github.com/airsdk/apm/wiki/Usage-Generate#android) and [iOS](https://github.com/airsdk/apm/wiki/Usage-Generate#ios)

If you plan to save contact images you will need to add the following permission using `apm`. 

Firstly, generate a custom config for your project:

```
apm generate config android
```

Then edit the `config/android/AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following line:

```xml
<!-- Optional: Needed if you are planning to save contact images -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" android:maxSdkVersion="28" />
```
