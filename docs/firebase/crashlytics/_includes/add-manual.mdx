The following guide is used to manually install the extension, download dependencies and update the application descriptor. We highly recommend installing extensions using `apm`. Using `apm` will automate the installation and automatically handle updates and dependencies along with greatly simplifying the application descriptor generation.

First step is always to add the extension to your development environment. 

:::caution Firebase Core

### Firebase Crashlytics

The main additional extension is the Crashlytics ANE located here:

- [`com.distriqt.firebase.Crashlytics`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-Firebase/raw/master/lib/com.distriqt.firebase.Crashlytics.ane)

Download the extension from the repository and then follow the tutorial located [here](/docs/tutorials/getting-started) to add the extension to your development environment.

This ANE contains all the required libraries for the main Firebase Crashlytics functionality.



### Android Support

The Android Support libraries encompass the Android Support, Android X and common Google libraries. 

These libraries are specific to Android. There are no issues including these on all platforms, they are just **required** for Android.

This extension requires the following extensions:

- [`com.google.dagger`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.google.dagger.ane)
- [`com.google.guava`](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport/raw/master/lib/com.google.guava.ane)

You can access these extensions here: [https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport](https://github.com/distriqt/ANE-AndroidSupport).
