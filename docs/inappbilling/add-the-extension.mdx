Here we will show you how to add the extension to your development environment and make the necessary changes to your application descriptor to correctly support the extension.

The extension supports different services and most likely you will not want to use them all in your applications. As such we have produced different "variants" of the extension (and air package) which include support for different services while providing exactly the same Actionscript API. 

However while the API is identical there are varying dependencies and application descriptor additions required. As such we have broken the guide for adding the extension into the various services, each showing the variant(s) that support the service and the required additions to your application. 

:::info Variants
The base variant supports the most common services, being:
- Apple In-App Purchases;
- Google Play Billing;

The other variants generally include these services as well but also include additional stores. If you are looking to support them we suggest using the following install guides. 

- [Amazon](amazon/add-the-extension.mdx)
- [Huawei](huawei/add-the-extension.mdx)
- [Samsung](samsung/add-the-extension.mdx)

The guide below will focus on Play Billing and Apple In-App Purchases.

## Install

The simplest way to install and manage your AIR native extensions and libraries is to use the AIR Package Manager (`apm`). We highly recommend using `apm`, as it will handle downloading all required dependencies and manage your application descriptor (Android manifest additions, iOS info additions etc).

However you can choose to install it manually, as you would have done in the past. 

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<InstallAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<InstallManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>


## Application Descriptor

<Tabs
  groupId="packagemanager"
  defaultValue="apm"
  values={[
    {label: 'APM', value: 'apm'},
    {label: 'Manual', value: 'manual'},
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="apm" >
	<AppDescriptorAPM/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" >
	<AppDescriptorManual/>
  </TabItem>
  
</Tabs>



## Checking for Support

You can use the `isSupported` flag to determine if this extension is supported on the current platform and device.

This allows you to react to whether the functionality is available on the device and provide an alternative solution if not.


```actionscript
if (InAppBilling.isSupported)
{
	// Functionality here
}
```

:::note 
This only checks if there is some functionality supported, not whether a particular billing service is available.
